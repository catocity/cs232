Sentence:
the set in the sky
but the eternal walked out of the silver mine
my pockets full of sand
alone inside my head
alone inside my room
i feel alone inside my head
alone inside my tiny little world
it's not my life in those old pictures
the ones you threw away
for i was always someone else
and always far away
walking in the darkest places
where the mission meets
watiting for the ground to open up
beneath my feet
alone inside my head
alone inside my room
i feel alone inside my head
alone inside my tiny lit

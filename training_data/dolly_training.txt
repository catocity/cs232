"BLACK DRAUGHT THEME
TRADITIONAL
Smile from the inside out smile from the inside out
Black Drought makes you smile from the inside out"
"As you walk away
As we say good-bye
What I wouldn't give
For a tender lie
Say you'll never stop loving me
Just as if it were true
How much more damage now honestly
Could one tender lie do?
When we fall so far
Are we wrong to try?
To keep out the truth
With a tender lie
Say you're gonna come back to me
And I'll believe that it's true
How much more damage now honestly
Could one tender lie do?
Say you're gonna come back to me
And I'll believe that it's true
How much more damage now honestly
Could one tender lie do?
How much more damage now honestly
Could one tender lie do?"
"(Dolly Parton)
I wish you all the luck I wish you only the best
Satisfaction in love, and true happiness
I wish you blue skies and rainbows, I wish you joy pure and sweet
I wish you all that you wish for, but only if you're with me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I wish you nothin' but trouble if you've decided to leave
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I have had you too long, I have given too much
I have loved you too strong to think of giving you up
I've always envied those lovers that wish you well when you leave
And wish you luck with another; but there are others like me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
And every face you look into, I hope you're haunted by me
Yes, I'm possessive and jealous; at least I speak honestly
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy, never ever ever happy
Never ever ever happy
With anybody but me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I wish you nothin' but trouble if you've decided to leave
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy"
"I want to tell you all a story 'bout a harper valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter that attended harper valley junior high
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said, ""mama, i've got a note here from the harper valley pta""
Well the note says ""mrs. johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
Now we don't believe you ought to be a bringin' up your little girl this way""
And it was signed by the secretary, harper valley pta
Well it happened that the pta was gonna meet that very afternoon
And boy, were they surprised as mrs. johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard i can still recall the word she had to say
She said ""i'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley pta
Now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
And mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And mr. baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down
Now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's bar again
And if you smell shirley thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think that i ain't fit
Well this is just a little payton place and you're all harper valley hypocrites"
"ou know people been talking about the end of time ever since time began
We've been living in the last days ever since the first day ever since the dawn of Man
Well nobody knows when the end is coming but some people tell you they do
Well it might be today, it might be tomorrow, or in a million years or two
In the meantime, in between time, let us make time to make it right
And let us not fear what is not clear; faith should be your guide, just follow this advice:
And
Think about love; Think about living
Think about love-- sharing and giving
Drop the Doomsday attitude and let the spirit flow
These are wonderful times we're living in
God still walks in the hearts of Men
And Eden's garden waves within so let the flowers grow
Well we rant and we rave about the ""good ol' days"" and how different it was ""back then""
Well the greatest days we've ever known are the days we're living in
Well we worry about earthquakes, aliens from outer space, nuclear holocaust
Well we're so consumed with the fear of dying; the joy of living is lost
In the meantime, in between time, let us make time to make amends
Lead the good life, just treat this planet right and try to all be friends and say with me again:
Ohhh!
Think about life; Think about living
Think about love-- caring and giving
Drop this Doomsday attitude and get on with the show
We've walked on the moon; been to Mars
Technically we've come so far
But still we wonder who we are
The farther along we go
You know people been talking about the end of time ever since time began
We've been living in the last days ever since the first day ever since the dawn of Man
Well nobody knows when the end is comingwell that's what the Scriptures say
But that's a secret known only to God, he says to just watch and pray
In the meantime, what's the hurry?
In the meantime now don't you worry
In the meantime live, laugh- be merry
In the meantime, in the meantime
In the meantime troubles gonna show us
In the meantime the sky is still above us
In the meantime you know God's gonna love us
In the meantime, in the meantime, in the meantime"
"You can't reach me anymore
You say I'm not the girl that you remember
You say that I hve changed so much and you can't seem to rach me
Well you destroyed everything I used to be before and you can't reach me anymore
I was looked up to you while you were looking down
It used to turn me off inside when you would turn me down
Now you want the love from me that you destroyed before
But you can't reach me anymore
Now you say you love me more than anything
I used to love you that way now I don't feel a thing
The love that once lived in my heart don't live there anymore
And you can't reach me anymore
I was looked up to you while you were looking down
It used to turn me off when you would turn me down
Love that once lived in my heart it don't live there anymore
And you can't reach me anymore oh oh oh no you can't reach me anymore"
"(Dolly Parton)
We once were so close now the love light
That glowed has now gone out of our eyes
And the good life we had for some reason went bad
And the love that once lived here has died
How did we get here, where did it start
When did we walk out of each other's hearts
Where did we lose it, how did love die
When, where, and how, but most of all why
Most of all, why did we let love die
Like the withering leaves in the fall
And why did we wait 'til it was to late
To realize how much we lost
How did we get here, where did it start
When did we walk out of each other's hearts
Where did we lose it, how did love die
When, where, and how, but most of all why"

Yes I see God where the mountains reach the sky
And I see God when the eagle starts to fly
I see God in a little baby's smile I see God and he makes my life worthwhile
Yes I see God when the bridegroom meets his bride
I see God in a father's loving eyes
I see God when a mother starts to cry I see God in a love that never dies
(I see God) where the people meet to pray (I see God) in the things they do and
say
(I see God) when the little children play
I see God and I know he's near all way
I see God yes I see God"
"We three kings of Orient are bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain moor and mountain following yonder star
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain gold I bring to crown him again
King forever ceasing never over us all to reign
Star of wonder star of night star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding guide us to Thy perfect light
Frankincense and moor have I my gift of love and sacrifice
Pray'r and praising all men raising worship in God most high
Oh star of wonder star of night..."
"Sugar pie honey bunch you know that I love you
I can't help myself I love you and nobody else
Wanna tell in and out my life you come and go
Leaving just your picture behind
and I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your finger or wink your eye I come a running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings and there's nothing I can do
Sugar pie honey bunch I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you tell you that we're through and I've tried
But every time I see your face I get all choked up inside
When I call your name girl it starts the flame burning in my heart
tearin it all apart no matter how I try my love
I cannot hide 'cause"
"Well my wife and I were happy in our trailer
But she didn't dig my runnin' around all night
Well I warned you a couple of times of leavin'
Oh but you just laughed and took it kinda light
Well I should've paid attention to her warnin'
When she told me she'd leave if I didn't change
Cause when I come home about sunup this mornin'
Well I detected something mighty strange
Her and the car and the mobile home are gone boys
I was takin' off while you was a carryin' on
Now things are really shot I came home to an empty lot
Yeah me and the car and the mobile home was gone
Yeas her and the car and the mobile home was gone
Well the neighbors all around me were a laughin'
And it made me feel about ten inches tall
Ha I knew you didn't think that I'd really leave you
Ah not to mention taking home and all
Well talk about somebody be-wildered
I bet you didn't know what to do nor where to go
I found a little consolation in my wardrobe
That you left scattered on the patio
Her and the car and the mobile home..."
"Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
Like T-O-why or maybe S-you-are-P-are-I-S-E
But the words we're hiding from him now
Tear the heart right out of me
Our D-I-V-O-are-see-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-see-E
Watch him smile, he thinks it's Christmas
Or his 5th Birthday and he thinks see-you-S-T-O-D-why spells fun or play
I spell out all the hurtin' words and turn my head when I speak
'Cause I can't spell away this hurt that's drippin' down my cheek
Our D-I-V-O-are-see-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-see-E"
"She married the one I love today
When my back was turned she took him away
Now while they're all outside, waiting to throw rice
What I want to throw will surely black her eyes
Cause I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad
Well I never stole nothin' in my life
But if I get the chance I'll steal him from his wife
Cause all is fair in love and war, maybe I'm carryin' this too far
But I feel like tying dynamite to her side of the car
No I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad"
"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying the stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying the stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
Oh, it makes me wonder
Oh, it makes me wonder
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
Oh, it makes me wonder
Oh, it makes me wonder
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying the stairway to heaven"
"I know what you're thinking when you look at me
The love in your eyes is so easy to see
It's real and it's good what I feel for you
Love is worth living when you love like we do
I understand when you're not feeling well
If there's something on your mind I always can tell
I'm there when you need me and you're there when I need you
Love is worth living when you love like we do
Love is worth living when you love like we do
We found the happiness that very few do
You know that I want you and you know that I want you
Love is worth living when you love like we do
[ piano ]
Love is worth living...
Love is worth living when you love like we do"
"Peace in the valley for me some day
Well, I'm tired and so weary, but I must travel on
'Til the Lord comes and calls me away, oh, yes
Where the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night is as bright as the day, oh, yes
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
Only peace in the valley for me, oh, yes
Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh, yes
And the beasts from the wild shall be led by a little child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh, yes"
"At my door the leaves are fallin'
A cold wild wind will come
Sweet hearts walked by together
And I still miss someone
I go out to a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Cause I still miss someone
Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there"
"Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your roof's too close at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You are the reason I'm traveling home
Don't think twice, it's alright
There ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
That night, I never know'd
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me want to change my mind and stay
We never did do much talking anyway
Don't think twice, it's alright, no
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright
But there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
Like you never did before
And there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
'Cause I can't hear you anymore
Well, I'm thinking and wonderin' all the way down the road
I once loved a man but that love grew old
I gave him my heart, but he wanted my soul
Don't think twice, it's alright
Walking down that lone lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound well I can't tell
But goodbye is too good a way, babe
So I'm gonna say thee farewell
But I ain't saying you treated me unkind
You could have loved me better, but no, I don't mind
But you just kinda sorta wasted my precious time
Don't think twice, it's alright, no
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright"
"Downtown tonight, I saw an old friend, someone who
I use to take comfort from long before I met you
I caught a spark from his eyes of forgotten desire
With a word, or a touch, I could have rekindled that fire
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do
Flickering embers of love
I've known one or two
But old flames can't hold a candle to you
Sometimes at night, I think of old lovers I've known
I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone
Like stars in the night lost in the sweet light of dawn
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do
Flickering embers of love
I've known one or two
But old flames can't hold a candle to you
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
Mmmm"
"(Dolly Parton)
Someday when I'm over you
And when I think I'm able to
Well, I might try to be
Your friend again
But your restless heart
And rovin' eyes
My jealousy, these endless fights
I've got to get out of your life
Or I will never mend
I guess I'll die a bit each day
But I'm always dying anyway
And I don't have the heart to
Stay, and I can't take the pain
I know we've tried to no avail
Our heaven now has
Turned to hell
The same old hurt
We know so well
And something's got
To change
We both know it's got to end
The passion's gone
It's just pretend
And one of us have got
To make the move
We might as well just give it up
We've lost respect and
There's no trust
And without this, there's
No real love
It's just some sad excuse
I guess I'll die a bit each day
But I'm always dying anyway
And there's nothing left but walk away
Ain't this a crying shame
A change of pace
A change of heart
A change of place
A place to start
And we'll be better off apart
Our only chance is change
And we never wil
But something has to change
But someday when I'm over you
And when I think I'm able to
Then I will try to be your friend again
But I don't want to see
Your face 'til then
Change, I need a change
I need a change
We need a change"

"It seems we lost the feeling somewhere along the way
The distance now between us grows farther day by day
We never love each other we're just passing off the time
Wasting love yours and mine
Wasting love love divine wasting love yours and mine
There's nothing left between us just the ties that bind
Wasting love yours and mine wasting love
We just might find happiness with somebody new
For all the love we're wasting surely could be used
Not long ago our love was so true and kind
Now it's been wasted yours love and mine
Wasting love love divine...
Wasting love yours and mine wasting love"
"(Dolly Parton)
John Daniel came to town one summer afternoon
Wearin' dirty work clothes so everyone presumed
He was just another logger from the loggin' camp nearby
And he was, but there was somethin' different in John Daniel's eyes
John Daniel was a young man, not more than twenty-four
And there was an air about him that one could not ignore
And in spite of callused hands & dirty clothes, his face was kind
And I wanted so to know what was in John Daniel's mind
John Daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's somethin' about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
I rented him a room; he went upstairs like all the rest
It was Saturday and he'd be goin' in to town, I guessed
But he left in a robe and sandals, with a Bible in his hand;
And I thought to myself, John Daniel, I don't understand
Now I'd planned to meet some friends of mine when I got off at three,
In the park we often gather to talk of love and peace
When I got there I found that a crowd had gathered 'round;
And there I saw John Daniel a sittin' on the ground
John Daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's somethin' about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
So, ""You want to be free,"" he said, ""Well, this is how you can.""
As he read from the Bible he held in his hand
We were searchin' for the truth not knowin' where to look,
Not knowin' that the answers all were in John Daniel's book
John Daniel told us all how we could be free
John Daniel taught us all a better way for you and me
He came to us in our own way so we'd be sure to see
He had the light and essence of the man from Galilee
John Daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's something about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
John Daniel, John Daniel, John Daniel
John Daniel do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
John Daniel came to town one summer afternoon
Wearin' dirty work clothes so everyone presumed
He was just another logger from the loggin' camp nearby
And he was, but there was somethin' different in John Daniel's eyes
Ooh, John Daniel, tell me where did you come from
Tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's something about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?"
"Oh you took your sweet love from me oh you left me sweet sweet memories
And I cry I cry like a little baby cause there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh there's still a lot of you left in me and I cry cause your love'll set me free
Your love'll set me free
I'll keep holding on to love that used to be cause there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh I still go on to all our favorite places and I still see all our friends we used to see
Oh but I'm thinkin' now I'm just not the same without you
And that there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh there's still a lot of you...
Cause there's still a lot of you left in me"
"I became a woman of the world cause I was fed up with the farm
And I thought pretty clothes and city lights
Running round both day and night could do no harm
A party girl I mixed for bout myself into a fix for running wild
So I wrote my dad and mom asked if I could come back home to have my child
I received the letter from the folks back home and they said things were fine
They went on to say that Pete the boy I broke up with was about to lose his mind
But I couldn't hardly read the rest the words were being bloted by my tears
I'm feelin' so ashamed he loved me then he feels the same he still cares
So I'm going home for Pete's sake it was I who broke his heart in the first place
If he'll try me one more time for then I've made up my mind
And in the morning I'm going home for Pete's sake
Yes for Pete's sake my baby's and mine"
"May the fruit of my toil be yours love
May the food from my soil be yours love
And from this moment on
May a love that is strong
That lives on and on be yours love
May the sons that I raise be yours love
May the comforts I praise be yours love
If I ever get weak may the love words I speak
And the arms that I seek be yours love
May the Lord's shining grace be yours love
May the happiest face be yours love
May the last fingertips that touch these two lips
As life from me slips be yours love
And from this moment on
May a love that is strong
That lives on and on be yours love"
"Dawn is slowly breaking
Our friends have all gone home
You and I are waiting
For Santa Clause to come
There's a present by the tree
Stockings on the wall
And knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all
The fire is slowly fading
Chill is in the air
All the gifts are waiting
For children everywhere
Throught the window I can see
Snow begin to fall
Knowing you're in love with me
Is the greatest gift of all
Just before I go to sleep
I hear a church bell ring
Merry Christmas everyone
Is the song it sings
So I say a silent prayer
For creatures great and small
Peace on Earth, good will to men
Is the greatest gift of all
Peace on Earth, good will to men
Is the greatest gift of all"
"When I look out over a green field of clover
Or watch the sun set at the end of the day
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty
And everything's beautiful in its own way
When I see a fountain flow from a mountain
Or see April showers bring flowers to May
I can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder
And everything's beautiful in its own way
Words can't describe what I feel inside
When I see the beauty in each coming day
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
And everything's beautiful in its own way
When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger
The storm's even beautiful in its own way
When I see leaves drop off from the treetop
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder
God made all things beautiful in their own way"
"(Dolly Parton)
The work is hard and the hours are long
The money ain't much but we get along
We're rich in things can give
That can't be bought with a dollar bill
So, come on down
Have a look around
Rich folks livin' in a poor folks town
We got no money but we're rich in love
That's one thing that we've got a-plenty of
So come on down have a look around
At rich folks livin' in a poor folks town
We got no carpets on the floor
We've got wall to wall love
Who could ask for more
We got no big fine things to show
Just a place to watch our children grow
We got no big fine fancy car to drive
And no fancy clothes to keep in style
What we've got we're payin' on
But it's mostly love that we're livin' on
So, come on down
Have a look around
Rich folks livin' in a poor folks town
We got no money but we're rich in love
That's one thing that we've got a-plenty of
So come on down have a look around
At rich folks livin' in a poor folks town
We've got a little simple church nearby
And the promise of a mansion in the sky
A heart of gold a million dollar smile
And a one way ticket to paradise
So, come on down
Have a look around
Rich folks livin' in a poor folks town
We got no money but we're rich in love
That's one thing that we've got a-plenty of
So come on down have a look around
At rich folks livin' in a poor folks town
So, come on down
Have a look around
Rich folks livin' in a poor folks town
We got no money but we're rich in love
That's one thing that we've got a-plenty of
So come on down have a look around
At rich folks livin' in a poor folks town"
"(Dolly Parton)
There's a place in my mind that's suspended in time
When we were happy in love
Days warm and sweet, and the night so complete
Then life was perfect for us
It was just you and I, only love in our eyes
Not a sign of a tear on our face
No sorrow, no pain, only sunshine, no rain
Before something else took its place
Oh, I wanna go back there
Back to the time there was no doubt you cared
Back to the time love was tender and fair
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Do you think if we tried we could put life aside
And see if we might make it back
I know in my heart what we had at the start
I believe it could still be like that
Oh, I wanna go back there
Away from these heartaches, these worried and cares
Back to the time love was tender and fair
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there (say you care)
I wanna go back, I wanna go back
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there"
"I can live in a mansion or a double-wide
Eat sushi raw or my catfish fried
Wherever I am, then that's where I belong
'Cause I'm quite content with who I am
And if you ain't, well, kiss my ham
Country is as country does and I'm country to the bone
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I always will be, that's for sure
Country born and country bred
Countrified and country-fed
A country heart and a country head
'Cause I'm country to the core
Now, I can drive a tractor or a Cadillac
I can fly first class or slum in the back
But I'll be the same ol' gal when I arrive
Oh I can wear denim or I can wear silk
Drink champagne or chocolate milk
Take the best or live with less, 'cause a country girl survives
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
And the way I'll be until they lay me low
Country born and country bred
I'm countrified and I'm country-fed
And I'll be that way 'til I'm country dead
'Cause I'm country head to toe
And what you see is what you get
Nothing's ever changed me yet
Nothing will, it's a pretty safe bet
'Cause I'm country through and through
Oh, that's country!
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I'll be until my dying day
I'm country born and country bred
Countrified and country-fed
And nothing done and nothing said can change my country ways
Nothing done and nothing said
Nothing's gonna change my country ways
I don't think so
Wouldn't change if I could
Country is as country does
It's the way I is and it's the way I was
Country born and country bred
I'm countrified and I'm country-fed, you know that
I'm country (she's country)
But now that don't mean I can't go to town!"
"(Dolly Parton)
The work is hard and the hours are long
The money ain't much but we get along
We're rich in things can give
That can't be bought with a dollar bill
So, come on down
Have a look around
Rich folks livin' in a poor folks town
We got no money but we're rich in love
That's one thing that we've got a-plenty of
So come on down have a look around
At rich folks livin' in a poor folks town
We got no carpets on the floor
We've got wall to wall love
Who could ask for more
We got no big fine things to show
Just a place to watch our children grow
We got no big fine fancy car to drive
And no fancy clothes to keep in style
What we've got we're payin' on
But it's mostly love that we're livin' on
So, come on down
Have a look around
Rich folks livin' in a poor folks town
We got no money but we're rich in love
That's one thing that we've got a-plenty of
So come on down have a look around
At rich folks livin' in a poor folks town
We've got a little simple church nearby
And the promise of a mansion in the sky
A heart of gold a million dollar smile

"Life has dealt us our fair share of pain along the way
And many dreams have withered on the vine
But dreams are all such fleeting things and happiness is now
We'll just live our lives one day at a time
In all the stormy weather love has always seen us through
Happiness is knowing that you're mine
Why worry about tomorrow for tomorrow may not come
We'll just live our lives one day at a time
This one thing I'm learning you take life as it comes
Each day is just a gift so don't be blind
Tomorrow may bring gladness or a little bit of sadness
We'll just live our lives one day at a time
[ guitar ]
We may not have a fortune making plans to change the world
We may leave little marks in life's design
But as long as we're together every hour is filled with love
And we'll just live our lives one day at a time
Just one thing I'm learning...
We'll just live our lives one day at a time"
"(Dolly Parton)
He's a go getter, go getter
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her
Now I've got a neighbor that lives down the road a ways
His wife holds down a steady job, he don't turn his hand all day
I know that most of you will know the kind I'm talkin' about
The kind that rather than have to work, he'd rather do without
But he's a go getter, a go getter
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her
There's a group of men in the court house yard any time that you go by
Playin' checkers and tradin' odds and makin' jokes about their wives
They wait all week for pay day and they hold the money's plenty
And the wife that's worked those long hard hours never gets a penny"
"What a friend we have in Jesus all our sins and grieves to bear
And what a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer
Can we find a friend so faithful who will all our burden share
We should never be discouraged take it to the Lord in prayer
What a friend we have in Jesus...
What a friend we have in Jesus"
"What to do and where to start?
Things are falling all apart
Trying hard to move ahead
But keep losing ground instead
Still I have to take a chance
Putting fear and doubt aside
Had no warning in advance
Nothing left to do but try
[Chorus:]
And I just might make it work
I just might make it after all
I just might rise above the hurt
Thought I've suffered quite a fall
But I have to get a grip
And hold on to it like a vice
Have to face the falling chips
I just might make it, I just might
Oh, I might have been a fool
But its true that love is blind
And you have broken every rule
You've taken all that yours and mine
And How does one go on with life?
When your shattered so inside
Pieces of a love gone wrong
Well, ya pick'em up and you move along
[Chorus:]
But I just might make it work
I just might make it after all
I just might rise above the hurt
Thought I've suffered quite a fall
I just might live to see the day
I can say ""hey I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright""
I better go on either way
Rise above it, I just might be stronger then I know
Well, I might even be surprised
I've got to get on with my life
I just might make it
I just might
Nothin left to do but try
I might make it
I just might"
"Love it's not I who didn't try
Hard enough, hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough
Love you don't see
The pain in me
That's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cried for us, I cried for us
I'll take my share but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff
Easy enough
And if you choose I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough
I've tried and tried to put aside
The time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked"
"(Dolly Parton)
The word ""If"", just two tiny letters
Says so much for something so small
The biggest little word in existence;
Never answers, just questions us all
If regrets were gold, I'd be rich as a queen
If teardrops were diamonds, how my face would gleam
If I'd loved you better, I wouldn't be lonely
If only, if only, if only
But looking back now I see clearly
With my twenty-twenty hindsight
Oh, but don't think I haven't paid dearly,
'Cause you could be in my arms tonight
If regrets were gold, I'd be rich as a queen
If teardrops were diamonds, how my face would gleam
How I let you go, I swear is beyond me
But if only; ah, if only; oh, if only
I could start over, if I could go back
Have the power to change things
Then I would do that
But I listened to others like a fool,
Oh, shame on me
But if only you would just come back
If only, dare I even ask
Oh, if only"
"Oooh,OOh,Oooh-ooh,Oh,Oh,Oh,Oh-oh-oh-oh.
Well, I can't tell you where I'm going
I'm not sure of where I've been
But I know I must keep travelin'
Till my road comes to an end
I'm out here on my journey
Trying to make the most of it
I'm a puzzle I must figure out
Where all my pieces fit
Chorus
Like a poor wayfairing stranger
That they speak about in song
I'm just a weary pilgrim
Trying to find what feels like home
Well, that is no one can tell me
Am I doomed to ever roam
I'm just travelin' travelin' travelin'
I'm just travelin' on.
Questions I have many
Ansewers but a few
We're here to learn the spirit burns
To learn the greater truth
We've all been crusified
And they nailed Jesus to the tree
And when I'm born again
You're gonna see a change in me
God made me for a reason
And nothing is in vain
Redemption comes in many shapes
With many kinds of pain
Oh, sweet Jesus if you're out there
Keep me ever close to you
As I'm stumbling tumbling
As I'm traveling through
I'm just traveling traveling traveling.
I'm just traveling through ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
I'm just traveling traveling
I'm just traveling through ooho ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Oh sometimes the road gets rugged
And it's hard to travelin' on
But hold in to each other
We don't have to work alone
When everything is broken
We can mend it if we try
We can make the world a difference
If we want to we can fllly.
Good-bye you little children
Good-night you handsome men
Farewell to all you ladies
And to all who knew me when...
And I hope I'll see ya down the road
You meant more than I knew
As I'm travelin' travelin' travelin' travelin' travelin' through
Drifting like a floating boat
And roaming like the wind
Oh give me some direction lord
Let me lean on you
As I'm travelin' travelin' through (Repeat, Repeat)
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like the poor wayfaring stranger
That they speak about in song
I'm just like a weary pilgrim
Tryin' to find my own way home
Oh, sweet jesus if you're out there
Keep me ever close to you
As I'm travelin' travelin' travelin' through
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh travelin' through."
"(Dolly Parton)
Thumbing for a ride by the edge of the road
With a brown paper bag to hold my clothes
But tonight I'm going home where I belong
If the good lord's willing and the creek don't rise
And if my luck holds out, and I catch me a ride
When the sun goes down tomorrow, I should be home
This big city ain't no kind of place
For a country girl with a friendly face
If you smile people look at your funny, they take it wrong
They laugh at my talkin' and clothes I wear
They put me down and they call me square
But tonight I'm going home where I belong
I'm goin' back to the people I love
Back to the place that I dream of
It's true that there's no place like home sweet home
The one I want to see the most
Is the boy who begged me not to go
When the sun goes down tomorrow
Tonight I'm going back where I belong"
"It seems we lost the feeling somewhere along the way
The distance now between us grows farther day by day
We never love each other we're just passing off the time
Wasting love yours and mine
Wasting love love divine wasting love yours and mine
There's nothing left between us just the ties that bind
Wasting love yours and mine wasting love
We just might find happiness with somebody new
For all the love we're wasting surely could be used
Not long ago our love was so true and kind
Now it's been wasted yours love and mine
Wasting love love divine...
Wasting love yours and mine wasting love"
"If I, could be with you forever
My restles heart
Would never want to roam
I've never been loved
The way you love me
[Chorus]
I wish I felt this way at home
When you kiss me
It's words without speaking
And I don't believe that
God would call this wrong
Your arms are the refuge
I was seeking
[Chorus]
But I don't, and I won't
We did all that we could
He and I
We tried hard
But it's just no good
I may never be free
'Cause I've no reason
And I don't expect you to wait that long
But I'll say one more time
As I'm leavin'
[Chorus]
Yes, I wish I felt this way at home"
"(Dolly Parton)
It's just one emotion after another
They will dress themselves as angels and theives
They will make you believe you're in heaven
Then they'll drag you through hell on your knees
It's just one emotion after another
One day I'm up just as high as it goes
Next day I'm down to the lowest of lows
I do love you baby but we can't get along
With or without each other it's al right or it's all wrong
It's hard to determine where the balance should be
We swear It's forever while we're packing to leave
Each time we end it I swear never again
But the minute you come knockin' I can't wait to let you in
It's just one emotion after another
They will dress themselves as angels and theives
They will make you believe you're in heaven
Then they'll drag you through hell on your knees
It's just one emotion after another
It's been that way since lovim' began
Like an ocean love flows with it's highs and it's lows
Like the tide it just goes out and in
It's just one emotion after another
It's just one emotion after another
But I guess that's just the way that it goes
Love is rainbow and rain, Love is pleasure and pain
I cannot stay the same I suppose
But I love you and that's all I know"
"From the start I promised you that I would always be
Waiting here at anytime you ever needed me
I loved you then and I love you now as I always will
And I am always waiting willing to forgive
I'll be your shelter from the storm
My love will keep you safe and warm
I'm a harbor on your stormy sea you can always come to me
For I am always waiting
My arms are always open wide and I will dry the tears you cried
If you should ever need someone darling let it be me
I will mend your broken heart and I'll replace the missing parts
I am always waiting anytime you need me
I'll be your shelter from the storm...
For I am always waiting"
"The neon lights of a movie marquee
Says the show today is Love Is Free
And inside a boy and a girl on a date
Their folks are gone away they're gonna stay out late
A little later on in a lover's lane
They park in the dark with their hearts in flames
He says oh baby go along with me
I need you so and love is free
In a simple little room in a Chatanooga home
For girls that need a friend and are all alone
She waits for a letter that never comes
From a boy that won't admit what he's done
She had to leave school cause she couldn't stand the shame
Her daddy said she ruined the family name
Her mama cries herself to sleep at night
That's no way to start a young girl's life
Love isn't free no it ain't free
No matter what they say somebody has to pay for love
In an orphanage home a sad little girl
Six years old and all alone in the world
She knows by now what they never say
That she once had a mom but she gave her away
People come to visit but don't choose Marie
She cries at the door nobody loves me
And somewhere a boy doesn't care at all
That her tear at night stains her little rag doll"
"As I travel life's pathway to that city beyond
I find the way so narrow and my strenght almost gone
Then I cry oh Lord have mercy please don't leave me all alone
Cause somehow I've got to make it make heaven my home
I'll keep climbing I'll keep climbing till I make it my home
And I'll soon be with Jesus round the great white throne
Though the way may seem rugged Lord I must travel on
I'll keep climbing I'll keep climbing till I make heaven my home
My friends they forsake me my companions are few
I'll keep my eyes toward heaven no matter what others do
I'll keep my mind upon Jesus for his way I will choose
Soon I'll reach heaven's portal seems it's almost in view
I'll keep climbing...
I'll keep climbing...
Make heaven my home"
"(Dolly Parton)
Our love affair is bitter sweet
Insecure and incomplete
And I've often wondered why your leaving's been so long delayed
It's all become so complicated
Maybe you feel obligated
And out of simpathy for me you stay
But I had rather live alone
Than live with someone who doesn't love me
And I'd rather have you go than stay
And put me down a thinkin' you're above me
Our love affair is so wound up
It's best that we unwind
And if you don't love me, leave me
And don't let it trouble your mind
You've waited much too long to leave afraid of how I'd take it
And I'm deeply touched by your concern but I think I can make it
It won't be easy for a while but I'll forget in time
And if you don't love me, leave me and don't let it trouble your mind
I had rather live alone
Than live with someone who doesn't love me
And I'd rather have you go than stay
And put me down a-thinkin' you're above me
Our love affair is so wound up
It's best that we unwind
And if you don't love me, leave me
And don't let it trouble your mind"
"With great anticipation he waited at the door
His only son was due from overseas
For months now he'd been waitin' since he'd gone off to war
And his eyes were filled with tears of great relief
Welcome home, son
His loving arms held open and his heart so full of love
Welcome home, son
I've been prayin' and been hopin' and I never did give up
I knew that you'd return to me
The place where you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long.
I hear him say as they embrace
""I've waited so long for this day
My son, my very own... Welcome home.""
But a dreary rain was falling while another soldier fell
And a mother wakes up crying in the night
She thought she'd heard him calling in that moment she could tell
Her only son had passed into the light
Welcome home, son
His loving arems held open and his heart so full of love
Welcome home, son
As Jesus stood there glowing, their hands reached out and touched
I knew that you'd return to me
The place that you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long
As they embraced I heard him say
""I've waited so long for this day
My son, my very own... Welcome home.""
Now I think of all the families that have lost a darling one
And I think how Jesus died for all our sins
And I think how much God loved us to send his only son
To live and die, and then to live again
Welcome home son
I hear God saying when they nailed Christ to the cross that day
Welcome home son
And when he sent his angels to roll that stone away
I knew that you'd return to me
The place where you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long
I hear God say as they embrace
""I've waited so long for this day
Well done my faithful son... Welcome home.""
Welcome home!
I hope to hear God saying when it's my time to go!
Welcome home!
While the angel band is playing and God comes to claim my soul!
The angels will be singing and joybells will be ringing!
Rejoicing! I'll shout and sing along!
When there are no more wars to fight
And we're all children of the light
When the father and the son say
""Welcome home!""
Tag: Welcome home, welcome home, welcome home."
"Got my eye on a boy
He's eyeing me back
It's looking real good
This could be it
And I know that all of you girls
Would love to steal him away
He bought me a drink
I thanked him real sweet
It's always so nice when you first meet
And I know that all of you women would love to steal him away
So I'm warning you
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Building up an appetite
You can look but you can't buy
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Pretty as a picture
Comin' on so strong
He's twisting my ignition key
Turn my motor on
But anyone can see, all his attention's on me
Give us some privacy
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
It's a welcome turn to try
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Leave us alone tonight
Then if it don't work out right
He's all your's
Until then
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
They keep crowdin' in on me
He smiles rather unsuspiciously
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Building up an appetite
You can look but you can't buy
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend"
"(Dolly Parton)
Mama, it's so good to be back home again
I'm so proud to see that you are looking well
Yes, I know that I look a little weary
Oh, but Mama, I have been through living hell
You know how much I've always loved him, Mama
But he done things to me I couldn't understand
Why, he made me watch him love another woman
And he tried to make me love another man
Mama, can I be your little girl again?
I need you now even more than I did then
And I need a lot of love and understanding
And a lot of time to get me over him
If I lose my mind, Mama, I wanna be here with you
Have them lock me up and see I have good care
But I just couldn't stand his torture any longer
I was afraid of what I'd do if I stayed there"
"(Billy Joel)
Hey Lord, take a look on around tonight
And find out where my baby's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For he is far away from me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
Make sure that he's gonna be alright
Things gonna be alright with me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
And make sure all his dreams are sweet
Send down that ya got him on the road
But you'll make it softer for his feet
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
Make sure that he's gonna be alright
'Til he's home and here with me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For he is sleeping under the sky
Hey Lord, make sure the ground he's sleepin' on
Is always warm and dry
Ooo, don't give him too much pain
And keep him away from planes
Cause my baby hates to fly
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For it gets rough along the way
And if it all sounds strange
Just because I don't know how to pray
Ooo, won't you give him peace of mind
And if you ever find the time
Tell him I miss him everyday
Hey Lord, take a look on around tonight
And find out where he's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For he is far away from me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
Make sure that he's gonna be alright
'Til he's home and here with me
Here with me"
"(Dolly Parton)
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Strangers meet and they willingly surrender
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
Almost went to Aspen but something told me no
I considered Mammoth but there wasn't enough snow
And I even thought of Gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go
So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes
And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way
Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet
With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood
But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Change the radio and I'll turn the lights down dimmer
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
Strangers when we met, lovers as we leave
Christmas to remember, too good to believe
Don't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again
We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind
And you've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
We loved and laughed and played and joked
Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks
Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes
Then to the lodge for dinner
But now it's time for us to go
As our hearts melt like chimney snow
There's just one thing I want to know
Can we do this next winter
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers
Oh! What a Christmas to remember"
"(Dolly Parton)
Preacher Tom, your friends are many
And your good deeds are a plenty
And I know that God is plenty proud of you
Cause you've directed your attention
Towards a bright and shining mansion
God promise to the ones that pay their dues
So preacher Tom, come on preach,
Let the one of which you speak have his way
Let his precious will be done
Preacher Tom, come on
Teach of the one always in reach
Saying who so ever will let him come
Preach on preacher Tom, preach on
Your smile is like the sunshine bringing warmth and joy to others
And love controls your understanding heart
And the message that you spread is just like water to the thirsty
A beacon that keeps shining through the dark
So preacher Tom, come on preach,
Let the one of which you speak have his way
Let his precious will be done
Preacher Tom, come on
Teach of the one always in reach
Saying who so ever will let him come
Preach on preacher Tom, preach on

Teach of the one always in reach
Saying who so ever will let him come
Preach on preacher Tom, preach on"
"Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside, there was somethin' going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got somethin' goin' on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
Needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothin' if you got no one
And you did walk in tonight
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one, in love forever
We can ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah
Sail away
Oh, come sail away with me
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah"
"Oh, say can you see,
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,
Through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched,
Were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare,
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?"
"Wouldn't it be fine if you could say you love me
Just one time with a sober mind?
Wouldn't that be fine, now wouldn't that be fine?
Wouldn't it be great if you could love me first
And let the bottle wait?
Now wouldn't that be great, now wouldn't that be great?
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Lord, it's for our sake, wouldn't that be great?
In the name of love, what's the man so great?
Keep thinking of what a man he was
In the name of love, in the name of love
Love went away when the sexy lace wouldn't turn his face
The bottle took my place, love went to waste
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Wouldn't it be good? And I know
You could if you just would
Wouldn't that be good? And you know you should
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?"
"I wasted my tears
When I cried over you
I wasted my tears
When I cried over you
I should've known
You would never be true
I loved and I lost you
Now I'm so blue
I wasted my tears
When I cried over you
You said that you loved me
And would always be true
Now you gone'n left me
Oh, what will I do
Oh, why did you leave me
For somebody new
I wasted my tears
When I cried over you
I wasted my time
When I spent it with you
But one is so blind
When love is so new
Now out of my fears have come true
I wasted my tears
When I cried over you"
"As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto
People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto
As her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto"
"(Porter Wagoner)
They say most anything you eat could hurt your health
Be careful what you drink, don't harm yourself
And pollution in the air might make you sick
Makes you afraid to live, afraid that you might die too quick
Do the men that quote this danger really know
Life is gift to be enjoyed and not to worry so
The biggest danger sign that we should know
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go
We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'
And afraid to love the one we love, afraid they might be lyin'
We can't enjoy life when they say each thing might bring an early grave
We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'
Do the men that quote this danger really know?
Life is gift to be enjoyed, why worry so?
The biggest danger sign that we should know
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go"
"There are those who'd love to love me
Take me home and take care of me
Treat me just the way you never do
But I'm here on your door step
Something I can't seem to help
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you
[Chorus:]
Oh, you don't love me, you don't love me
You place everything above me
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you
You don't want me, you don't want me
You just hurt and disappoint me
Like a fool, I'm holding on to, ooh, ooh
Like a fool, I'm holding on to you
What is this spell that's on me
Make me think you own me
Why do I keep holding on to you
I just can't shake the feeling
I only know it's real
And I keep holding, holding, holding on to you
[Chorus:]"
"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord,
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee"
"Come and sit by the side of your mother my boy
You have only a moment I know
And stay while I give you this parting advice
It is all that I have to bestow
Hold fast to the right hold fast to the right
Wherever your footsteps may roam
Oh for sake not the the way of salvation my boy
That you've learned from your mother at home
In your satchel you'll find there's a Bible my boy
It's the book of all others the best
It will teach you to live and prepare you to die
And will take to the gates of the blest
Hold fast to the right hold fast to the right...
[ ac.guitar ]
Hold fast to the right hold fast to the right...
Oh hold fast to the right"
"To be with you is what I want more than anything
But I must share my life with the one who wears my ring
And there are tiny places I look into each night
I love you but my hands are tied
I know how much they need you and dear I understand
I know you'll never leave them cause you're not that kind of man
But I can't control my feelings though heaven knows I tried
And I love you but my hands are tied
My hands are tied and I can't break the ties that bind
I love you more than life but you never will be mine
I know how much you want me I can see it in your eyes
And I love you but my hands are tied
[ steel ]
My hands are tied and I can't break the ties that bind...
Yes I love you but my hands are tied"
"Chas I cook your a breakfast and send you to work
I mend your clothes Chas I iron your shirts
There's so much thought in each thing that I do
And all of the time Chas I'm loving you
And I greet you each evening Chas when you come home
I miss you so badly while you are gone
And if I make you happy then I'm happy too and all of the time Chas I'm loving you
Chas I rock your babies I teach them to talk
I care for your wife Chas because she can't walk
I do all the things she's unabled to do and all of the time Chas I'm loving you
I want you so much but your wife need you Chas
You'll never be mine and I'll never ask
I know that you love her and I love her too but all of the time Chas I'm loving you
I look at you Chas you look at me but what I am thinking must never be
I love you so much and it's hard to resist
I want you but I I couldn't take you from sis
But all of the time Chas I'm loving you"
"You left you didn't say goodbye
You never gave me a reason why
My tears are dried now it's been a while
Now there you szand you're back again
Do you think that time stands still do you think that time stands still
Things have changed I've rearranged so many things
Do you think that time stands still do you think that time stands still
It never has it never will do you think that time stands still
You won't to start where we left off
Somebody found the love you lost
Love has its price we've paid the cost
We lose and learn now it's your turn
Do you think that time stands still...
Do you think that time stands still...
Oh do you think that time stands still..."
"This is how I learned it from a Time-Life Album in about 1958.
There's a little rosewood casket
Lying on a marble stand
And a packet of old love letters
Written by my true love's hand
[Go and bring them to me sister
Read them o'er for me tonight
I have often tried but I could not
For the tears that filled my eyes] I did not know this verse--Thanks!
Last Sunday I saw him walkin'
With a lady by his side,
And I thought I heard him tell her
He would never be his bride.
When I'm dead and in my coffin
And my shroud's around me bound
And my narrow grave is ready
In some lonely churchyard ground.
Take his letters and his locket
Place together o'are my heart
But the golden ring he gave me
From my finger never part"
"There was a time we'd sit in the backyard cause the house would get so hot
From the summer sun there was no way of sleepin'
And you'd play your old guitar we'd fight mosquitoes and enjoyed
You backyard concerts for we had no television
We'd just begun our life as man and wife and hard ships then
Could scaresly scare us into quittin'
Things were far from bein' fine we often dined upon a dime
But there never was a time we didn't love
The Christmas brought us saddest days
When your pride gave a way you told the kids
There'd be no gifts cause we were broke
Though their little tears of grief was so hard to see it didn't hurt me
Like the love I knew was in your throat
It was then with arms entwined we both broke down and cried
For it seemed ike nothing good would ever come
The doctor bills we couldn't pay they came and took our car away
But there never was a time we didn't love
Now there's an easy chair for my back a satin pillow for your head
And the kids are wild about the brand new car
You and I can order steak with all the trimmings and not worry
If we've spent a dollar more than we can spare
No wonder in your prayers we've thanked the man upstairs who led us through
The years of rearin' kids and payin' bills
And I think he guide us not because we were smart but just because
There never was a time we didn't love
No there never was a time never was a time never was a time we didn't love"
"(Dolly Parton)
My train of thought was broken by a sudden burst of laughter
Something badly needed to lighten up the chores
Seemed old Mrs. Bailey had accidentally fell
In the water being used to scrub the floors
Now Mrs. Bailey was the meanest matron at the home
She believed in lots of work with little play
And we laughed till we bent double
Though we knew we'd get in trouble
But trouble's all we had at evening shade
Now evening shade was where they claim to teach you understanding
To teach you love and keep you off the streets
And all the kids that live there are said to be a problem
Juvenile delinquents so to speak
But understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger
An iron hand has no gentle touch and love ain't learned from hate
The reason we were there is 'cause we had no one who cared
But they cared even less at evening shade
Little Susan Bradley, one night had wet her bed
Mrs. Bailey took the razor strap and beat her half to death
And I knew that something must be done to put an end to this
And so I started talking plans with the older kids
Plans were that Joe Johnson would steal the kerosene
And I would get some matches when nobody seen
Beckie Adams would make sure the kids were all outside
Billy Watson would look out for the evil eye
Now Mrs. Bailey took a nap at three o'clock each day
We knew that she'd be a'sleeping as the plans got underway
Now that its all over and the sun is going down
There's no evening shade because we burned it to the ground
Evening Shade was burning just like the hell it was"
"The city streets are empty, it's beginning to feel like dawn
The lights have gone out, the sun is coming on
We've been standing here for hours watching the river flow
You walked into my life tonight but if you've got to go
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
I've been saving all my secrets, spending my time alone
I've given up on the life I used to know
I've been waiting for one person to love me like a friend
You walked into my life tonight but if it's got to end
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
Oh, it's easy now to tell you how I'm dreaming 'bout tomorrow
Cause you'll be there to share that dream with me
But now it's time to close your eyes put this night away
And keep it safe, a perfect memory
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
Oh, oh, oh
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a little while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but don't you say goodbye
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while"
"(Dolly Parton)
Sweeter than honey, as soft as a sigh
Gentle as snowflakes but warm as July
This is the way I remember your kiss
If I live forever, I'll never forget
Misty as morning, as blue as the sky
Reflections of Heaven in your loving eyes
Eyes that said more than your words ever did
And if I live forever, I'll never forget
If I live forever, I'll never forget
It's you that I'm wanting to spend my life with
Do I still love you? The answer is yes.
And if I live forever, I'll never forget
Two loving arms that I felt welcomin'
Arms that I've run to again and again
How do you erase sweet memories you miss
If I live forever, I'll never forget
Sad circumstances that stood between us
Wouldn't let us share our precious, sweet love
Do you remember, do you feel like this?
If I live forever, I'll never forget
If I live forever, I'll never forget
It's you that I wanted to share my life with
Do I still love you? The answer is yes.
And if I live forever, I'll never forget
Do you remember, do you feel like this?
If I live forever, I'll never forget"
"There's a wreath on the door
She don't live here no more
As of today, she flew home
And we all gathered here
In sorrow and tears
It won't be the same with her gone
There's a place on the hill
That's peaceful and still
Where she'll sleep beside daddy again
The ole' family tree is shedding it's leaves
But we'll all met in heaven again
Chorus:
Oh, she's an angel
Let her fly, let her fly
She's gone home to glory
To her home in the sky
When God sees her comin'
Heaven's choir will smile
And sing, ""oh she's an angel, let her fly, let her fly
Ooh, she's an angel, let her fly""
She used to rock me when I was a child
Sing ""rock of ages"" and ""in the sweet bye and bye""
Her life wasn't easy, oh but how hard she tried
You know she's an angel, lord, so let her fly
Repeat chorus
Tag:
Let her fly
Ooh she's an angel, let her fly"
"Loving you isn't good for me you keep my tears flowing
If I loved you I couldn't stay gone so there's no use in going
Loving you is a habit I can't break
I haven't found a way yet but I've been tryin'
To stop loving you but I can't wait there's no use a lyin'
Loving you is a habit I can't break
Loving you is a habit I can't break
I've been loving you much too long now to change the way I feel
So I might as well get used to these heartaches
Loving you is a habit I can't break
[ piano ]
(A habit I can't break)
Loving you is a habit I can't break...
Loving you is a habit I can't break"
"(Dolly Parton)
She stands before the mirror
Smiles at her reflection
Striking sexy poses in the glass
She paints her lips a brilliant red
Piles her hair high on her head
Struggles to replace a false eyelash
She powders up her face
Paints her cheeks to match her lips
She wears a dress cut low in the front
Fittin' tight around her hips
And there inside her room
She stands and gazes at herself
Where beauty lives in memory
She lives in fairy tales
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor
She keeps a candle burning
And she waits for his returning
When beauty lives in memory
It lives forevermore
She was a fairy princess once
And was by all adored
They say she was the fairest of them all
They called her Cinderella
And they say that every fella
Would gladly answer to her beck and call
So the story went
They tell of how this handsome prince
Stole her heart and wandered far away
He took her heart and took her mind
Now she has lost all track of time
Forty years has passed and still she waits singing
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor
She keeps a candle burning
And she waits for his returning
When beauty lives in memory
It lives forevermore
Meanwhile back inside her room
The shads are pulled it's half past noon
But in her mind why it's forty years ago
She recalls the beauty of their love
She remembers he was beautiful
And of course she always knew she was
And so the past unfolds
And all at once inside her mind
She sees him at the door
And as he's leading her away
She feels the room begin to sway
Where beauty lives in memory
She falls dead upon the floor
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all
She sings as she goes waltzing' cross the floor
She keeps a candle burning
And she waits for his returning
When beauty lives in memory
It lives forevermore"
"I'm comin' home, I've done my time
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine
If you received my letter telling you, I'd soon be free
Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me, if you still want me
Whoa, tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
It's been three long years, do you still want me?
If I don't see a ribbon 'round the old oak tree
I'll stay on the bus forget about us, put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
Bus driver, please look for me
'Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see
I'm really still in prison and my love, she holds the key
A simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free
I wrote and told her please
Whoa, tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
It's been three long years, do you still want me?
If I don't see a ribbon 'round the old oak tree
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us, put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree"
"How long will you love me how long will you stay by my side
Will it be for a lifetime or just for a while
From now on yes on and on
If you will love and stand by me I'll give all my love to you
That's the way that it will be from now on yes on and on
From now on yes on and on from now on yes on and on
Love for each other that will stand the test of time
From now on on and on
I'll stand by you right or wrong then we'll always be as one
Like the robin needs his song I need you from now on
Like the rose loves the vine like the poem needs to rhyme
My love is yours and yours is mine from now on on and on
From now on yes on and on...
From now on on and on"
"(Dolly Parton)
Late one cold and stormy night I heard a dog a' barkin'
Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a' knockin'
I wondered who could be outdide in such an awful storm
Then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms
Before I could say a word she said, 'My name is Sandy
And this here is my puppy dog, it's name is little Andy'
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said
Ain't ya got no gingerbread
Ain't ya got no candy
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little Andy
Patty cake and bakersman
My mommy ran away again
And we was all alone and didn't know what else to do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you
Giddy up trotty horse, going to the mill
Can we stay all night
If you don't love us no one will
I promise we won't cry
London bridge is fallin' down
My daddy's drunk again in town
And we was all alone and didn't what we could do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you
She was just a little girl, not more than six or seven
But that night as they slept the angels took them both to heaven
God knew little Andy would be lonesome with her gone
Now Sandy and her puppy dog won't ever be alone
Ain't ya got no gingerbread
Ain't ya got no candy
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little (whispers) Andy"
"As I sit here tonite the jukebox's playin
The song about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words they are saying
It brings memories when I was a trusted wife
It was not God who made Honky Tonk Angels
As you said in the words of you're song
Too many times married men think, they're still single
And that's why many a poor girl do go wrong
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame
It was not God who made HTA
As you said in the words of you're song
Too many times married men think, they're still single
And that's why many a poor girl do go wrong"
"Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
The fireplace keeps burning and my thoughts keep turning
The pages of memories of time spent with you
Old Christmas songs we knew and used to make love to
Make it hard to get used to
Christmas without you
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you
Like a mystery with no clues
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
The sweetest gift I know would be if the new snow
Could fall on your footsteps on this Christmas Eve
The most joyous Christmas if luck could be with us
Would be if Saint Nicholas brought you home to me
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you I need you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you, like a mystery with no clues
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you, not something I can get used to
I just have no use
For Christmas without you
You know that I want you
You know that I need you
You know that I need you
You know that I want you
You know that I love you
I need you
I want you
Oh, yes I do!
You know that I want you
You know that I need you
You know that I need you
You know that I want you"
"You ask me not to wear cologne
Shell know youve been with me alone
And you cant take our secret home
So you ask me not to wear cologne
You can wipe the make up off
The lipstick or a little gloss
But fragrance lingers on and on
So you ask me not to wear cologne
You leave my bed and go to hers
Leaving me alone and hurt
I love you whether right or wrong
And you ask me not to wear cologne
Im not out to hurt someone
Not you, not her, not any one
But I got heartaches of my own
Why, I cant even wear cologne
Oh but I never meant for this to be
It wasnt in my heart to cheat
Love has a nature all it's own
So I willingly gave up cologne
And every time you come to me
I realize Im in too deep
I know you love us both and I keep holding on
You ask me not to wear cologne
You say, Dont wear cologne
Oh now what am I ever gonna do
Cause I am so in love with you
I know you love us both
But where do I belong
You ask me not to wear cologne
You ask me not to wear cologne
Shell know youve been with me alone
And you cant take our secret home
So you ask me not to wear cologne
How do I walk away from the greatest love Ive known
You ask me not to wear cologne
Oh you ask me not to wear cologne
You ask me not to wear cologne
Shell know youve been with me alone
And Im a scent you cant take home
But will I ever get to wear cologne"
"I could hold out my arms, say ""I love you this much""
I could tell you how long I will long for your touch
How much and how far would I go to prove
The depth and the breadth of my love for you?
From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Love everlasting, I promise you that
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back
I want you to know you can always depend
On promises made and love without end
No need to wonder how faithful I'll be
Now and on into eternity
From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Forever and always, I'll be where you're at
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back
I would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat
I would call out your name to echo through the vast
Thank heaven for you and to God, tip my hat
From here to the moon and back
And I'll spend forever just proving that fact
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back..."
"Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me!
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss-man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
An' the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5, whoa what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5, working 9 to 5"
"Waiting for the train to come
I keep a'waiting for the train to come
Dreamin' of the river and the rising sun
I keep thinkin' 'bout the world to come
My life packed up in a suitcase
Old man staring from a doorway
My hope tarries in the distance
Love comes on the wheels of my deliverance
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Waitin' for the train to come
I keep waitin' for the train to come
Keepin' my appointment with the one who lives
In the heart of everything that is
All night sleepin' in a station
My God, it's hard not to be impatient
I watch through the windows of forgiveness
I cry but my word's my only witness
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Sometimes I feel I can't go on, I can't go on
I get so tired, all passion's gone
My heart, my head, my arms, my legs, I get so tired
Without the strength to crawl away
Then something breaks inside my soul, My strength is gone
That spirit's finally taking hold
My ears can hear, my eyes can see
Those clouds of joy still cover me, cover me, cover me
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is, where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Fade:
Waiting for the train to come
I keep waiting for the train to come..."
"(Though I'm only second best you're still first with me)
I tried to make you love me I've done everything I could
I thought if I tried long enough maybe someday that you would
But there was someone else before me and it's her you're lovin' still
And I know no matter what I'd do I'm only second best
Only second best that's all I will ever be
Even though I'm second best you're still first with me
And I'll be loving you when they fall my hand I guess
I love you even though I know I'm only second best
I know you've tried to love me and I'd hope you would in time
I know that when you're holding me it's her that's on your mind
Now I know you can't get over her but I love you nonless
But it makes no difference what I'd do I'm only second best
Only second best...
I love you even though I know I'm only second best"
"I want to tell you all a story 'bout a harper valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter that attended harper valley junior high
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said, ""mama, i've got a note here from the harper valley pta""
Well the note says ""mrs. johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
Now we don't believe you ought to be a bringin' up your little girl this way""
And it was signed by the secretary, harper valley pta
Well it happened that the pta was gonna meet that very afternoon
And boy, were they surprised as mrs. johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard i can still recall the word she had to say
She said ""i'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley pta
Now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
And mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And mr. baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down
Now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's bar again
And if you smell shirley thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think that i ain't fit
Well this is just a little payton place and you're all harper valley hypocrites"

Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All ye maidens hede my warning
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
They will vow to always love you
Swear no love but yours will do
Then they'll leave you for another
Break your little heart in two
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
If I were a little sparrow
O'er these mountains I would fly
I would find him,yes I would find him
Look into his lying eyes
I would flutter all around him
On my little sparrow wings
I would ask him, yes I would ask him
Why he let me love in vain
I am not a little sparrow
I am just the broken dream
Of a cold false-hearted lover
And his evil cunning scheme
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All ye maidens fair and tender
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Oh the sorrow never ends"
"A corporation owns the factory I work in
Someone else owns the house we call our home
The bank owns the car we drive around
And we've got something we can call our own
We've got love happiness surrounds us
And we thank the Lord for every single day
And with love we'll always have each other
And together we can laugh the years away
[ steel ]
We're so thankful for our lovely children
And I work hard to keep new shoes upon their feet
But sometimes they've not too much on our table
But we've got something that's mighty hard to feed
We've got love happiness surrounds us...
We've got love happiness surrounds us..."
"Come and sit by the side of your mother my boy
You have only a moment I know
And stay while I give you this parting advice
It is all that I have to bestow
Hold fast to the right hold fast to the right
Wherever your footsteps may roam
Oh for sake not the the way of salvation my boy
That you've learned from your mother at home
In your satchel you'll find there's a Bible my boy
It's the book of all others the best
It will teach you to live and prepare you to die
And will take to the gates of the blest
Hold fast to the right hold fast to the right...

Hold fast to the right hold fast to the right...
Oh hold fast to the right"
"You left you didn't say goodbye
You never gave me a reason why
My tears are dried now it's been a while
Now there you szand you're back again
Do you think that time stands still do you think that time stands still
Things have changed I've rearranged so many things
Do you think that time stands still do you think that time stands still
It never has it never will do you think that time stands still
You won't to start where we left off
Somebody found the love you lost
Love has its price we've paid the cost
We lose and learn now it's your turn
Do you think that time stands still...
Do you think that time stands still...
Oh do you think that time stands still..."
"Sometimes in my sleep I hold you close against my skin
Wakin' up I wish that I could sleep and dream again
'Cause only in my dreams can I know how it might have been
But cheaters never win, their heartaches never end
But sometimes I get crazy as lovers often do
Trying to please him and wondering if she's pleasin' you
Though they have ever right to any part of us they choose
I still live just for you and our secret rendezvous
Torn between two lovers on the jukebox
I'm thinkin' how I could have wrote that song
Wonderin' if God loves us when we're cheatin'
Oh, but why he lets us feel things if it's wrong
And I guess I should be singin' ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"" and some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong
Thou shalt not commit, it's written in the ten
The spirit's always willin', but the flesh is weak again
And you're as close to heaven as I might ever fly
And angel in disguise
A wrong that feels so right
Torn between two lovers just keeps playing
I don't want to be right if lovin' you is wrong
I'm wonderin' if God loves us when we're cheatin'
Oh, but why we have to feel things if it's so wrong
And I guess I should be singin' ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"" and some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong
My cheatin' heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong"
"(Dolly Parton)
Pretty as an angel from the day that she was born
Skin as fair as Lily's hair, as golden as the corn
They knew that she was special from the moment she first cried
She was a mountain angel certified
She was her momma's baby, she was her daddy's pride
Good at home, at church and school, at everything she tried
Everybody's darlin' led a charmed and peaceful life
The perfect mountain angel 'til he arrived
And ohh, she fell so deeply
Ooh, she couldn't stop
She gave herself to him, milled it completely
He lifted her so high he let her drop
She gave up everything for him that mattered in her life
All the others that had loved her and she vowed to be his wife
She dreamed of bearing children in an ivy-covered house
The mountain angel's sunshine turned to clouds
The wicked handsome stranger left the way he came
Broke her heart and broke her mind
She never was the same
They say he was the devil
That had come to steal her soul
She never loved another it was told
They say she had a baby
Some say that it had died
They it's just as well
As it had been the devil's child
They say good conquers evil
But here, evil won the prize
So the mountain angel took to the wild
And ooh, she couldn't take it
Years passed and she had long since lost her mind
She waited for him as her beauty faded
Her parents died from grief before their time
She tried to gather pieces of her life, they wouldn't fit
Beside the tiny grave deep in the woods is where she'd sit
Talking to the child, herself, to him, who knew for sure
Possessed they say by satan's insane lure
High a'top the mountain, for years they say she's seen
Looking down upon the town where she had once been queen
She'd sneak around the playground, watch the little children play
They'd see the crazy lady then run away
They say she roamed these hills for years, wearing not a stitch
The lovely mountain angel now thought to be a witch
She made those wailing mournful sounds
That you could hear for miles
Long after she laid down upon her baby's grave and died
And ooh, her ghost is callin'
She's waiting for the ones that she adored
Through spring and summer, fall when snow is fallin'
Her spirit roams these hills forever more
The mountain angel's voices ever more
Oohh, oooo
Oohh, oooo
Oohh, oooo"
"(Dolly Parton)
A dirt dobber built its nest
On my only Sunday dress
And the roof leaked in my shoes
And when they dried they were too small
And the rats chewed a great big hole
In my only winter coat
And at night I'd hear them gnaw
The paper on my bedroom wall
But I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
Some happy and some sad
Some good and some bad
But I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
I used to wait by the garden gate
Where the hummingbirds came ev'ry day
To kiss the yellow roses
Growing up the garden wall
And in the tall grass I would lie
'Til ev'ning shadows brought the night
Thru the window of my room
I'd hear the whippoorwill's sad call
And I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
Some happy and some sad
Some good and some bad
But I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
Now as I make my way
Along the busy city sidewalks
My head arouring from the deafening city sound
You can't hear a whipporwill in this noisy city
And tall green grass don't grow
Along the sidewalks of this town
And hummingbirds don't fly around
These artificial roses
Like they did around the garden wall
And, oh, so often in my mind
I'll go back to another time
And I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
I still say
Those were the greatest days of all"
"You can dance
Every dance with the one who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that hold your hand
In the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Oh, I know
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing
But while we're apart, don't give your heart to anyone
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it with your touch
I will never ever let you go
I love you, oh, so much
You can dance
Go and carry on till the night is gone
Till it's time to go
If she asks
If you're all alone, can she take you home
You got to tell her no
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Ooh darling, save the last dance for me
You can dance
Every dance with the one who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that hold your hand
In the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Ooh darlin', save the last dance for me
Save the last dance for me
Dance, dance, dance, dance"

Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll fly away to you, if only pretending
We'll be like bluebirds do, the beautiful lie
The beautiful lie, the beautiful lie
Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll find my way to you, if I'm only pretending
And we'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie
We'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie"
"(Dolly Parton)
If there ever was an angel, then surely you must be one
If there ever was a perfect love when I look at you I see one
If there's heaven on earth, then this must surely be
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
The last thing I remember before I go to sleep
Is the touch of your sweet lips softly kissing me
And I go to sleep athinking how happy you make me
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
And when it's time to lay me down for my eternal sleep
Once more let your fingers softly touch my cheek
If I know that you have touched me, then I can sleep in peace
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
And when the night is over and time will be no more
They say that we shall meet again upon the golden shore
And so when I awaken from my eternal sleep
I want you to be the first one to touch me
I want you to be the first, the last, the only one to touch me"
"Crushed velvet drapes the walls of the room
Pillows all colors shapes and sizes on the floor
Mirrors on the ceiling reflect the candles burning low
Just close your eyes and travel anyplace you want to go
To lover's lane or far away to the mountain peaks of Spain
Crise along the Amazon where the deep blue waters flow
Our imagination will take us anyplace you want to go
[ steel - fiddle ]
Though we can only go there in our minds
Cause we cannot afford such luxuries so kind
The little room we live in is not much we both know
But the dreams we share can take us anyplace we want to go
Tonight we'll go to some majestic island
Ride the waves when the tie is rising
Lying in the silver sands where gentle breezes blow
The beauty of our love can take anyplace we want to go
To lover's lane or far away...
Anyplace you want to go"
"(M. Chapman)
I can't even begin to tell you
How I've been feelin' lately
But I have stumbled across something rare
And you use it to bait me
Something tells me go
Everyone says no, no, no
How can they be so cruel
When they tell me don't touch you
I tell them I'll die
In your red hot screaming love
In your red hot screaming love
If I'm losing my senses
They're lost in your deepest emotions
And the jets in my heart
They won't start till you set them in motion
Something tells me go
Everyone says no, no, no
How can they be so cruel
When they tell me don't touch you
I tell them I'll die"
"You packed in the morning
I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I miss you more
Than I missed you before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
Yes, you left me
Just when I needed you most
Now most every morning
I stare out the window
I think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me
'Cause I need you more
Than I needed before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
Yes, you left me
Just when I needed you most
You packed in the morning
I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I love you more
Than I loved you before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
You left me
Just when I needed you most
Oh, you left me
Just when I needed you most"
"Well, I met an old man walkin' down the street
His clothes were torn and tattered
With sandals on his feet
And I stopped to help him
And lend him a hand
He said, I love you so much
But you must understand
Silver and gold might buy you a home
But things of this world
They won't last you long
And time has a way of turning us old
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold
And he said to me, let's rest for awhile
For I have some good news to share with you, child
He said, you can't change this old world
The people need to know
That a dear savior died here
A long, long time ago
Silver and gold might buy you a home
But things of this world
They won't last you long
And time has a way of turning us old
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold
His eyes shown like diamonds
And his smile was heaven sent
His hair was long and flowing
And his back was slightly bent
And I knew he knew it
For that day I changed
As I watched him walk on
I forgot to get his name
He said, silver and gold can't buy you a home
When this life has ended
And your time is gone
But you can live in a world where
You'll never grow old
And things can't be bought there with silver and gold
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold"

I wasn't looking for you when I found you I just turned and I saw you there
And I was so lonely and lost when I found you and I needed somebody to care
And it had been so long since I'd been happy or needed or wanted or loved
And now that I've found you let my arms around you oh love have mercy on us
Have mercy on us don't let it be wrong for there is nothing to live all alone
And now that you're mine may love treat us kind oh love have mercy on us
Oh what must we do with this love for each other is it wrong to love one so much
I want to be with you and oh how I miss you oh love have mercy on us
Have mercy on us..."
"Well, I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
Saying something about a queen
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at mother nature on the run
In the twentieth century
Look at mother nature on the run
In the twentieth century
I was lying in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eye
I was hoping for replacement
When the sun burst through the sky
There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like I could cry
I was thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There was children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream, the loading had begun
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home"
"(Dolly Parton)
In my home town of Blackie, Kentucky
He came passin' through one dark, gloomy day
And I considered myself as lucky
When he told me he would take me away
And though he was older, it made me no difference
His promise of riches was all I could see
At last I could leave the coal mines of Kentucky
And know something better than sad poverty
Blackie, Kentucky, you know that I'll miss you
But there are other places in the world I'd like to see
So I must take this chance to be somethin' more than nothin'
But I'll always hold you in my memory
But I've never adjusted to sociable livin'
The friends that he knows, they're all strangers to me
Thousands of miles from Blackie, Kentucky
In a mansion with a husband that never loved me
He won't let my family and friends come to visit
Because they are country and poor, he's ashamed
Oh, but I'd give my life, Lord, if I could just go see them
All that's changed about me is my name
Blackie, Kentucky, oh Lord, how I miss you
If I could come back home, I'd never leave you anymore
I'd like to see my poor, hardworking, coal-minin' Daddy
And Mama, and the kids, and the friends I knew before
My world is as black as the coal in Kentucky
He won't let me leave him - there's no way to win
I'll take my own life, dear God, please forgive me
But I've got to get back home to Blackie once again
An' I've left him a note, in the mornin' he'll find it
It's my last request and he can't refuse me
I've told him to bury me back in Blackie, Kentucky
Where my family and my friends can come and visit me
Blackie, Kentucky I'm comin' home to you
But different from the way you remember me before
So make me a place and I'll lay me down to rest
And I'll sleep in your arms forevermore
I'll sleep in your arms forever more"
"Somebody's missing you
Longs to be kissing you
You'd better listen
You mean all the world to me
You're on somebody's mind
Just almost all the time
Bet you already knew
Somebody's missing you
The days go slowly by
When I'm away from you
I long to see your smile
And feel the warmth of you
I've loved you for so long
But still we feel brand new
At home, inside your arms
Somebody's missing you
Somebody's missing you
Longs to be kissing you
You'd better listen
You mean all the world to me
You're on somebody's mind
I hope you miss me too
Somebody's missing you
Last thought before I sleep
First thought when I awake
You're even in my dreams
And I can hardly wait
To hear your voice again
Saying all the things you do
In case you're wondering
Somebody's missing you
Somebody's missing you
Longs to be kissing you
You'd better listen
You mean all the world to me
You're on somebody's mind
Just almost all the time
I know you know I do
Somebody's missing you
In case you're wondering
Somebody's missing you
Really, really, really, really missing you"
"Sometimes I think of you and tears fill my eyes
To think of the meaning youve given my life
Youve touched me in places no one ever reached
Youve given me reason and cause to believe
You are my rainbow, youve colored my life
And you are my sunshine, Im warm in your light
You are my fountain that never runs dry
Youre my inspiration, my reason to try
Ill love you til green grass turns lavender blue
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew
Til horses and chariots chase down the wind
Thats when Ill leave you, Ill love you til then
Ill love you til green grass turns lavender blue
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew
Til horses and chariots chase down the wind
Thats when Ill leave you, Ill love you til then
Ill love you til green grass turns lavender blue
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew
Til horses and chariots chase down the wind
Thats when Ill leave you, Ill love you til then
Thats when Ill leave you, yes
Ill leave you then
Ill need you til then
Ill love you til then"
"Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you
But I hope it ain't for long
And I wonder if you're even gonna notice that I'm gone
Oh it hurts to know you cheated
And it hurt to know you lied
But it hurts me even worse to know you never even tried
I packed my suitcase full of heartaches
Headin' for the train depot
And I bought a one-way ticket
On that train they call Blue Smoke
I left the station straight-up midnight
Feelin' lonely, lost and blue
In a trail of blue smoke with my heart broke
Said good-bye to you
Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Oh, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through"
"(Dolly Parton)
Being born was the worse and the first mistake I ever made
The doctor didn't spank me, he just slapped me in the face
And the cup of love was always quenching someone else's thirst
Leaving me to swallow the bitter taste of hurt
'Cause I was raised an orphan
Never wanted as a kid until the year I turned 13
Then everybody did, strangers pass me back and forth
Men just took me as they pleased
And others had a Cinderella slave to cook and clean and weep
Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose, you have to play
The hand a life has dealt you
And It's a gamble either way
On a dust road at 15 in a yellow cotton dress
With the desert sun like an angry dragon breathing down my neck
And the dry cracked plains would make me think of a prehistoric time
Or should I fear what lay before me less than what I'd left behind
A 15 year old girl don't have no trouble hitching rides
But sometimes when you're riding free
You'll pay the highest price
On back roads and in back seats
And in a cheap highway motel
But what's a few more strangers in a life of nothing else
Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose, you have to play
The hand a life has dealt you
And It's a gamble either way
16 caught me crying, underneath the scarlet light
On the door steps of a stranger on a cold and rainy night
When I walked into the parlour here
Other pieces seemed to fit
I was good at pleasing strangers
So I made the most of it
Either way it's all a gamble
So view the stakes and know the odds
And lay your cards upon the table
Do all the dealing from the top
Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose, you have to play
The hand a life has dealt you
And It's a gamble either way"
"Just because all my dresses are just cotton hand me downs
His family calls me the lower class
Cause we're only poor folks on the other side of town
They won't let him walk up my path
But my mama says don't worry when they say those things about you
You remember, you're just as good as him
Just because they got that big house sittin' way upon the hill
Why, you don't have to look up to them
We've got chicken every Sunday and the preacher comes around
And every Saturday morning daddy takes us all to town
And we'd go to the picture show, have picnics on the ground
Oh, that's the lower class then I'm glad that's what I am
Cause my mama don't belong to the ladies social set
My daddy can't afford the country club
His folks look down on me and they don't let us date
Cause they think that I'm not good enough
But my mama says forgive him honey, he ain't worth at all
And if anything, you're too good for him
Just because they've got money and a big fine house
Aha, we won't take no sad talks off them
We've got chicken every Sunday and the preacher comes around
And every Saturday morning daddy takes us all to town
And we'd go to the picture show, have picnics on the ground
Oh, that's the lower class then I'm glad that's what I am
We've got chicken every Sunday and the preacher comes around
And every Saturday morning daddy takes us in to town"
"I found out the hard way
And I'm never gonna break your heart
I know, too late
And I don't wanna break your heart
Guess I had to go away just to find
What I left behind
You're the only one
You're the only one
Take me back
To where we started from
And let's make it now
Like we made it then
This ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again
Nights I lay in bed
And your covers wouldn't warm my feet
And morning found me
Bitter or a bit too sweet
Oh baby, I had to go away
Just to run back and say
You're the only one
You're the only one
Take me back
To where we started from
Can we make it now
Like we made it then
This ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again
You're the only one darlin'
They'll never be anyone else but you
I love you so much
You are my love, you've become my life
And I never meant to break your heart
But, sometimes, you just got to go away
To find what you left behind
You're the only one
You're the only one
Take me back
To where we started from
Can we make it now
Like we made it then
This ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
The only one
So take me back
To where we started from
You're the only one
The only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
The only one
Take me back
To where we started from"
"(Porter Wagoner)
He left me love enough to last a lifetime
A lifetime filled with loving memories
And so I have no reason to search for new love
Time could never take his love from me
And my mind is filled with memories, sweet and tender
My heart is filled with love he left for me
And each thought of him just makes love grow sweeter
He left me love to last eternally
I just close my eyes and I still see him
And in dreams, he loves me just like he used to do
He even wakes me with a tender kiss every mornin'
A kiss that lingers on my lips the whole day through
And my mind is filled with memories, sweet and tender
And my heart is filled with love he left for me
And each thought of him just makes love grow sweeter
He left me love to last eternally
Oh, yes, he left me love"
"There's nothing left to tie us to each other anymore
The love we knew is gone and that's a fact we can't ignore
There's nothing left to loose ends on all the ties that bind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
There's no use in wasting the good years that we have left
When we might find happiness with somebody else
There's no chance for us we can see it we're not blind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
The blame belongs to both of us I guess we didn't try
Love is like a garden without care we let it die
The flower of love can't bloom if the sun don't ever shine
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
[ piano ]
The blame belongs to both of us...
Though it hurts we know we must leave it all behind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
You're wasting mine you're wasting mine"
"Cindy was a ragged angel just a poor little girl on the street
Cindy's eyes showed signs of hunger never had enough to eat
Cindy was a ragged angel golden hair and eyes of blue
Cindy loved her paper dolly that's the only love she knew
Cindy never knew her daddy and her mommie was seldom home
Except for Cindy's paper dolly Cindy was all alone
Cindy slept with her paper dolly on a blanket on the floor
She would shiver as the wind blew through the crack beneath the door
One night she laid with her paper dolly cold and hungry on the floor
That night God came for the ragged angel
And now Cindy won't ever be cold and hungry no not anymore
Ragged angel"

Mother's hold on to your sons and you daughters
Should Hollywood claim them, you'll hold then no more
Cause they'll become claimed to the Hollywood potters
And there's no escape once they walk through that door
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama
Center of sorrow, city of schemes
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams
Some, they go hungry and some go insane
Some go to the bottle and some to the vains
Some become users and some become used
And some even make it, but most never do
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama
Center of sorrow, city of schemes
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams
You spin them around like a merry-go-round
You mold them and shape them and then throw them down
All of your glitter and all of your gold
Is that what you give in exchange for a soul
Cause they sell their soles for the likes of you
While you chew up and spit out what you cannot use
Mother's hold on to your sons and you daughters
Should Hollywood claim them, you'll hold then no more
Cause they'll become claimed to the Hollywood potters
And there's no escape once they walk through that door
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama
Center of sorrow, city of schemes
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams"
"The first strange town I was ever in
The county was hangin' a man
And nobody cared if he lived or he died
And I just didn't understand
So I washed my face in the morning dew
Bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew
And kept on moving along
The second strange town I was in
They were laughing at a poor crippled man
Begging for nickels and dimes on the street
And I just didn't understand
So I washed my face in the morning dew
Bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew
And kept on moving along
The third strange town that I was in
Was settled peaceful and nice
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer
And to me it didn't seem right
So I washed my face in the morning dew
Bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew
And kept on moving along
Now someday times are bound to change
It can't be very far
And each injustice that I have seen
Will come before the bar
Then I'll wash my face in the morning dew
Bathe my soul in the sun
Wash my face in the morning dew
And my journey will be done"
"It seems we lost the feeling somewhere along the way
The distance now between us grows farther day by day
We never love each other we're just passing off the time
Wasting love yours and mine
Wasting love love divine wasting love yours and mine
There's nothing left between us just the ties that bind
Wasting love yours and mine wasting love
We just might find happiness with somebody new
For all the love we're wasting surely could be used
Not long ago our love was so true and kind
Now it's been wasted yours love and mine
Wasting love love divine...
Wasting love yours and mine wasting love"
"Two little children a boy and a girl
Sat by an old church door
The little girl's feet
Were as brown as the curl
That fell on the dress that she wore
The little boy's cloths were all tattered and torn
They shown beneath his blue eyes
Why don't you go home
To you mommy I said
And this was the maddens reply
Mommy's in heaven
Angels took her away
Left Tim and I all alone
We've no one to love us
And daddy is dead
And our darling mother is gone
Mommy got sick
Angels took her away
To dwell in those mansions so bright
She said she would come
For her children some day
And I guess she's coming tonight
The sexton came early
To ring the church bell
And found them
Beneath the snow white
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell
Up in heaven with their mommy that night"
"I've chased after rainbows
I've captured one or two
I've reached for the stars
I've even held a few
I've walked that lonesome valley
Topped the mountain, sowed the sky
I've laughed and I have cried
But I have always tried
I've always been a dreamer
And dreams are special things
But dreams are of no value
If they're not equipped with wings
So secure yourself for climbing
Make ready for the flight
Don't let your chance go by
You'll make it if you try
So try to be the first one up the mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to be the one who makes a difference
Try to put your fear and doubt aside
And try to make the most of every moment
'Cause if you never try you never win
So try each day to try a little harder
And if you fall, get up and try again
(Try and try and try)
(Try and try and try)
Nothing is impossible
If you can just believe
Don't live your life in shackles
When faith can be the key
The winner's one who keeps determination in his eyes
Who's not afraid to fly and not afraid to try
So try to be the first one up the mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to count your blessings and keep counting
And try to soar where only eagles fly
And if you fail at first just keep on trying
For you are not a failure in God's eyes
The first step is the one that's always hardest
But you won't amount too much if you don't try
So spread your wings and let the magic happen
Cause you'll never really know if you don't try
(Try and try and try)
You gotta try (Try and try and try)
Come give it a try (Try and try and try)
You have to try (Try)
Oh I know it ain't easy
Who ever said it was?
Life is hard
Same as it ever was (Try)
You have to try (You have to try)
When you think you can't do it, just try a little harder
Just dig a little deeper and go a little farther but try (Try)
You have to try (Try)
Whatever it is, you're gonna get through it
Let the spirit lead you, I know you can do it, just try (Try)
Just give it a try
And whenever you think you ain't gonna make it
Put a smile on your face, suck it up and fake it
For a while (Give it a try)
At least you'll know you tried (Give it a try)
Don't think I don't suffer, I know what I'm saying
When I get to that place when I start praying and I try
Lord knows I try
Yes I try"
"Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him two lips like roses and clover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Sandman, I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic brean
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him the word that I'm not a rover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace
Mister Sandman, someone to hold
Would be so peachy before we're too old
Sp please turn on your magic beam
Mister Sandman, bring us
Please, please, please
Mister Sandman, bring us a dream"
"I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
And when it's cold outside,
Well I've got the month of May
I guess you say
What could make me feel this way
My love, my love, my love,
Talking bout my love, my love
I've got so much honey
You know the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Oh than the birds in trees
Oh and I know, I know,
I know what you're gonna say
What what could make me feel this way
My love, my love, my love,
Talkin' about my love, my love"
"You and I have been together for a long long time
And we vowed that we would stay together always
Life at times has been unpleasant down the trails where fate had led us
But we pray that God will let us be together always
Together together together always you and me
Forever and ever together always you and me
[ piano ]
Throught the years our love will multiply and be divided
By the children added to enrich our lives
God's been good to you and I and in heaven there's eternal life
Beyond this world where you and I will be together always
Together together...
Together together..."
"Now we don't know what Heaven looks like,
But we've seen enough Hell... right here and right now
But when the road is the roughest,
And the problems are the toughest,
Or when the times are the hardest and that ol' sky turns the darkest,
You gotta keep the faith,
'Cause I believe there's a better day,
And those ol' blues, why there gonna just roll right on away,
I know they are, listen to me.
All this blue, ain't sky and sea,
Some of this blue's bound to get on me,
But the blues, don't come to stay,
They'll move away
On a better day.
Troubles and woes and misery,
Ain't gonna get the best of me,
Lift the shades, fix my gaze,
On a better day
Clear the way
Better days, just up ahead
When sorrow ain't sleepin' in my bed,
When people ain't messin' with my head,
There's a better way,
There's a brighter day,
Oohh there's a better day
With clearer skies
Hope and promise on the rise
Oh the future that is looking bright
On a better day look away, look away
(interlude)
ohh ohh woahh ohh hmmm mmm hmmm
There's a better day
Oh better days, just up ahead
When sorrow ain't sleepin' in my bed,
And people ain't a messin' with my head,
There's a better day,
There's a better day
All of this blue, it ain't sky and sea
some of that blue's gonna to fall on me.
Oh the future's looking bright
There's a better day, look away, look away
Mmmhmmm mmm"
"We've been a searching for the love that lost its feeling
That one time filled our hearts with fire with love revealing
We thought that love had gone never more to be returning
And the fire that we thought had gone out again is brightly burning
Oh we found it oh we found it yes we found it yeah we found it
Joy to love joy to love we found it
And the lights are way down low the fire of love is high
We found it yes we found it oh we found it oh we found it
Sweet love you and I
[ steel ]
Well I never seen a lovelight shine so bright no wonder we found it
Shining like a neon light with love all around it
It's nights like this with love's sweet bliss sprinkled all around it
We cried a while but now we smile hmm hmm we found it
Oh we found it oh we found...
Oh we found it oh we found..."
"Lookin' outta my windowpane
Tears minglin' with the rain
I'm so lonesome I could cry, just like old Hank
Starin' down on the city street
Feelin' empty and incomplete
There's a place I need to be to fill my tank
A place I can go where I can be free
Where I can be happy and I just be me
Ho-o-ome
Where the warm wind's blowin' and the river's flowin' along
Like a lazy bum in the midday sun
And I've gone fishin' with my pole at the fishin' hole
Where I can lay down my heavy load
And know that I am always welcome home
I left home I was seventeen
I had a lot of ambitious dreams
Seen a lot of those dreams come true, I've had good luck
I ain't complain' that's for sure
I got a lot to be thankful for
One of those things is a magic door that opens up
Back to the time when I was a kid
To the sounds of crickets and the katydids
It's called ho-o-ome
On the front porch swingin'
And the fern pots hangin'
Ho-o-ome
With the church bells ringin'
And voices singin'
Those old songs that mend my mind like a stitch in time
Where the tea is sweet and the love complete
Oh me, I wanna go ho-o-ome
I often think about where I have been
Where I am goin' and that's about when I think about
Ho-o-ome
Where the soul finds comfort and the heart finds pleasure
Ho-o-ome
Where the depths of love is hard to measure
It's ho-o-ome
I hear you callin', I hear you callin'
I'll never be lost as long as I know
There's place like that where I can go
Where I can restore my weary soul
On the mountain slopes in the soft blue smoke
Of ho-o-ome
Home sweeet home. Ho-o-ome
Back to the hills with the whippoorwills
Of ho-o-ome
With the fireflies blinkin' and the night stars winkin'
Ho-o-ome
Honeysuckle vine and Muscadine wine
At ho-o-ome
Where the ginseng grows in the shady groves of ho-o-ome
With family and friends and joy that never ends
Ho-o-ome
There's no place like it, no place like it
Ho-ome"
"(Dolly Parton)
If there ever was an angel, then surely you must be one
If there ever was a perfect love when I look at you I see one
If there's heaven on earth, then this must surely be
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
The last thing I remember before I go to sleep
Is the touch of your sweet lips softly kissing me
And I go to sleep athinking how happy you make me
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
And when it's time to lay me down for my eternal sleep
Once more let your fingers softly touch my cheek
If I know that you have touched me, then I can sleep in peace
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
And when the night is over and time will be no more
They say that we shall meet again upon the golden shore
And so when I awaken from my eternal sleep
I want you to be the first one to touch me
I want you to be the first, the last, the only one to touch me"
"Letra de Miss You, Miss Me -
""Miss You, Miss Me""
Miss me,
Don't you miss someone to hold you, now in the end?
And kiss me
And tell me I'm your lil' girl again
Daddy, when you left, did you remove yourself
From every sweet remembrance of me?
I'm always missing you, I hope you miss me too
And everything we were and still could be
Miss little things like walking in the park
Miss summer nights with fireflies in the jar
Big memories of you playing your guitar
Miss all of this, it's true, but mostly I miss you
'Cause no one else could ever take your place
And momma, don't you miss that home is all about
And all the drama caused by the anger you keep acting out?
Why can't you both just see, you didn't divorce me?
Forgive, forget and try to get along
I miss us being close, I love and miss you both
Don't miss the plea I've written in my song
Your little miss is missing out on you
And you're both missing out on so much too
Put pride aside and do what you should do
Don't make me have to choose,
'Cause I love the both of you
Just let resentment go, and think of me
You've torn my world apart, and it breaks my little heart
Can't you see me? And see me missing you?
Oooh, I miss you, I miss you, miss me!
Miss me! I miss you. Miss me!"
"Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
And I dreamed about the cotton fields and home
I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sister and brother
And I dreamed about the girl who's been waiting for long.
I want to go home, I want to go home
Oh, how I want to go home.
Home folks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars, by night I ake the bars
If only they could read between the lines.
I want to go home, I want to go home
Oh, how I want to go home.
Cause you know I rode a freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find I've just been wasting my time
So I think I'll take my foolish pride
And put it on the south-bound freight and ride
And go on back to the loved ones
The ones that I left waiting so far behind.
I want to go hoe, I want to go home
Oh, how I want to go home."
"Crushed velvet drapes the walls of the room
Pillows all colors shapes and sizes on the floor
Mirrors on the ceiling reflect the candles burning low
Just close your eyes and travel anyplace you want to go
To lover's lane or far away to the mountain peaks of Spain
Crise along the Amazon where the deep blue waters flow
Our imagination will take us anyplace you want to go
[ steel - fiddle ]
Though we can only go there in our minds
Cause we cannot afford such luxuries so kind
The little room we live in is not much we both know
But the dreams we share can take us anyplace we want to go
Tonight we'll go to some majestic island
Ride the waves when the tie is rising
Lying in the silver sands where gentle breezes blow
The beauty of our love can take anyplace we want to go
To lover's lane or far away...
Anyplace you want to go"
"(Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner)
Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't live with you gone
Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't make it alone
You bring me the sunshine when none is in sight
And when I'm in darkness, you bring me the light
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see
So please, oh, please don't stop loving me
You're my inspiration, my purpose in life
When things go all wrong, you make them all right
I would be useless if you ever leave
So please, oh please don't stop loving me
Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't live with you gone
Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't make it alone
Please, please don't stop loving me"
"Remember all the castles that we once built in the sand
Remember how we used to go and visit fairy land
Remember how we'd search for that pot of gold at the rainbow's end
But you loved me then
And the flowers the we picked from the fields where we did run
And the sunbeams that we'd catch from the summer's golden sun
And the butterflies we'd chase as we'd go running through the wind
But you loved me then
Now I walk through the ruins of our castles in the sand
When you left I lost my way forever and the fairy land
Now the rainbows have all gone and the flowers have all died
And the sunbeams that we caught have all gone free again
And the butterfiles we chased have all gone with the wind
And you no longer care but you love me then
(And you no longer care) but you love me then
(And you no longer care) but you love me then"
"(Dolly Parton)
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All ye maidens hede my warning
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
They will vow to always love you
Swear no love but yours will do
Then they'll leave you for another
Break your little heart in two
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
If I were a little sparrow
O'er these mountains I would fly
I would find him,yes I would find him
Look into his lying eyes
I would flutter all around him
On my little sparrow wings
I would ask him, yes I would ask him
Why he let me love in vain
I am not a little sparrow
I am just the broken dream
Of a cold false-hearted lover
And his evil cunning scheme
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All ye maidens fair and tender
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Oh the sorrow never ends"
"Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you
Close the door to temptation
don't let me walk through
Turn away from me, darling
I'm begging you to
Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you
I belong to another
Whose arms have grown cold
But i promised forever
To have and to hold
I can never be free, dear
But when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing
The will to be true
Please help me, I'm falling
And that would be sin
Close the door to temptation
don't let me walk in
For i mustn't want you
But, darling, i do
Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you"
"(Dolly Parton)
We might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank
We fed ourselves from the fruit of the land
And quenched our thirst with rain
We never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet
Life just had no pattern for Gypsy Joe and me
All we had was each other and the rags upon our back
The closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack
But we had all we needed and the rest we didn't need
Life was free and simple for Gypsy Joe and me
Now Gypsy was my little dog, I found by the road in a ditch
And so I named him Gypsy, cause that name just seemed to fit
Oh and Joe he was my man, the flower of my soul
Thou he never said he loved me, I just always seemed to know
While standing by the highway, thumbin' for a ride
The speeding wheels of a passing car, took Gypsy's life
I lost him where I found him and his loss was misery
Now there's no more Gypsy, there's just Joe and me
Well the winter came and the snow did fall
And the night was cold and still
And the rags we wore were not enough
And Joe he caught the chill
And he told me how he loved me
And in my arms he went to sleep
Now there's no more Gypsy, no more Joe, there's just me
While standin' here on the edge of this bridge
Lookin' down I see
The face of Joe and Gypsy, lookin' back at me
And somewhere in the distance I can hear them callin' me
Tonight we'll be together again
Gypsy, Joe and me"
"(Dolly Parton)
Stay out of my bedroom
Don't be messin' up my pillows and sheets
With your powder and perfume
If you don't have some understanding of me
Don't be kncokin' on my door
I don't want you to play in my fantasies
Stay out of my bedroom
Baby, if you can't take the heat
If you want it, come and get it, baby
Satisfaction guaranteed
I'm a pleaser, free and eager
I ain't never had as much fun as I need
Easy lovin', that's down my alley
I may be easy but, at least I'm cheap
Stay out of my bedroom, baby
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Stay out of
Stay out of
You're dealin' with some hot stuff
Baby, can you deal with the heat?
We might burn on forever, we might burn on tonight
Where there's smoke there is fire from the flames that I ignite
The heat is intense when the fire's blazin' high
Slavin' over all those red hot lovers at night
If you come to my bedroom the heart of the heat
I will pleasure your body in sheer ecstasy
I will touch you in places no one else ever reached
Till you won't remember anybody else but me
If you want it come and get it
If it burns you don't come cryin' to me
Don't come knockin' on my door
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Don't be peepin' through my window
If you don't appreciate what you see
Stay out of my bedroom, baby
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Stay out of, stay out of
You're dealin' with some hot stuff
Baby, can you deal with the heat?
Stay out of my bedroom...
If you can't take it, stay out of my bedroom"
"You never send me flowers or ever buy me candy
You never bring me pretty things when you come to see me
And you forgot my birthday oh I wish you could see
How I miss the little things that you don't do for me
You never say that I look nice or that you're proud of me
You overlook the little things that you should see
These little things are big enough to hurt but too small to make me want to leave
But I do miss the little things that you don't do for me
Now how can I miss flowers that never reached my door
How can I taste candy that's still at the candy store
These little things mean a lot to me to you they may be silly
But I do miss the little things that you don't do for me
Yes I miss the little things that you don't do for me"
"Satin sheets to lie on
Satin pillows to cry on
Still I'm not happy don't you see
Big long Cadillacs, tailor maids upon my back
Still I want you to set me free
I've found another man
Who can give more than you can
Though you've given me everything that money can buy
But your money can't hold me tight
Like he does on a long long night
No, you didn't keep me satisfied
Satin sheets to lie on
Satin pillows to cry on
Still I'm not happy don't you see
Big long Cadillacs, tailor maids upon my back
Still I want you to set me free
Satin sheets to lie on
Satin pillows to cry on
Still I'm not happy don't you see
Big long Cadillacs, tailor maids upon my back
Still I want you to set me free"
"I can't live with you when you try to own me
Though you may give me love like I have never known
But if you try to control me then you won't never know me
And I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong
So love me just for what I am don't try to change a thing
And I'll take you just like you are and I'll expect the same
So if you want to love me you must understand all of me
For I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong
And I have no control over what I feel inside
And I can't change the way I am and you must be satisfied
So if you think you can't be without place and chance on me
Then I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong
I have no control
I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong"
"There'll be love love love oh precious love
Just as long as there's two people there'll be love
In spite of hate that fills the land love will always have command
As long as there's two people there'll be love
God created man and woman at the start
And he placed inside of them a lovin' heart
But it wasn't God that made the hate and lust
But as long as there's two people there'll be love
There'll be love love love...
[ guitar ]
For every person somewhere there's a mate
It's the force for survival that brings hate
For even though the going might be rough
As long as there's two people there'll be love
You can lock a man behind a prison wall
And you may think that he has no love at all
But there's someone somewhere that he's thinking of
For as long as there's two people there'll be love"

I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
You say that wasn't you I saw with someone else last night
You say you've never done me wrong you've always treated me right
I know it was dark but not that dark and I'm not that blind
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I'm fed up with you and the way that you do
I used to love you now I change my mind
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I once believed everything you've said I was so in love with you
You said I was the only one now I know that wasn't true
Now I know just where I stand I'm tidin' your cheatin' line
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I'm fed up with you...
I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line"
"Oh dear I'm so tired and so lonesome
I wonder why mommy don't come
She told me to shut up my blue eyes
And before I woke up she'd be home
She said she was going to see Grandma
Who lives by the river so wide
And I guess my mommy's feeling bad
And perhaps she won't be home tonight
So I guess I'll go down and meet daddy
Perhaps he has stopped at the store
It's a great big store full of bottles
And I wish he wouldn't go there anymore
So out in the night with the baby
Her little heart beating with pride
'Til her tired feet entered the gin palace
With music all radiant with light
Oh daddy she cried as she reached him
I think that the music's so sweet
But it's almost suppertime daddy
Little blossom wants something to eat
A moment his blurred eyes gazed wildly
Down into her face sweet and fair
And as the demon possessed him
He grasped at the back of a chair
A moment a second was over
He lifted her fair golden head
A moment the baby's left trembled
Then poor little blossom was dead"
"As we were dressing to go out our little girl and boy
Came in and asked if they could go this time
We told them little girls and boys don't belong at parties
And that they should be in bed asleep by nine
The babysitter came in then and we kissed the kids goodbye
And told them that we'd be home soon and told them not to cry
Then we left for the party like we'd so often done
Thinking only of ourselves and not our little ones
The party started out wild and it grew wilder as the night wore on
With drinking laughing telling dirty jokes nobody thinkin' of home
Then the strangest feeling came over me and it chilled me to the bones
And I told my wife that we'd better leave the party
Cause I felt that we were needed at home
As we rode along I got to thinking of how the kids that morning
Had asked if we would take them to church the next day
And how I'd put 'em off like I'd so often done
By saying we'd probably get home too late
Then my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of sirens
As they cut through the still night air
Then we turned down our street that's when we saw the fire
The rest was like a nightmare
We took their little bodies to church the next day
Though we'd left the party early we still got home too late"
"I was so excited when you asked if I could go
But mom said I'd have to ask my daddy
I met him at the front door so afraid that he'd say no
But he smiled and said, ""Let mama get you ready.""
In your cotton shirt and faded jeans, you came for me
And the gingham dress was all I had to wear
With a dollar in your pocket and a borrowed car
You picked a yellow daisy for my hair
That's the way it could have been
Oh, that's the way it should have been
If I had met you way back then
That's the way it would have been
I put away my gingham for a pretty dress of white
And you wore a suit instead of faded jeans
Our wedding day was perfect and we loved away the night
Life for us was filled with lots of dreams
We bought a house upon a hill outside of town
And two young people finally settled in
And you just won't believe the little children running 'round
And they pick yellow daisies now and then
And that's the way it could have been
Oh, that's the way it should have been
If I had met you way back then
That's the way it would have been
That's the way it could have been"
"(G. O' Dowd, R. Hay, M. Craig & J. Moss)
Last night you breathed the deepest sigh
Turned away with those gold cold cool eyes
You said won't you give me space to breathe
But my tears gave you confidence to leave
Now you say I'm just too much for you
There are things you'll never know
If you lie and cheat so easily
Ya better go, you better go
Go, go, go, you better go
All I know is how I feel
And my heart is always yours to steal
But you take and never give to me
Your kisses are charity
Your kisses are charity
Yesterday you were my brightest star
But even when you're near
I don't know where you are
I was wrong to show my weaker side
Now it's much too late to cry, cry, cry
I was blind to put my trust in you
If you leave me, I'll fall apart
Did you plan to make a fool out of me
From the start, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal
But you take and never give to me
Your kisses are charity
Your kisses are charity
Now you say I'm too much for you
There are things you'll never know
If you lie and cheat so easily
Ya better go, you better go
Go, go, go, you better go
All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal
But you take and never give to me
Your kisses are charity
You never give to me
All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal
But you take but never give to me
Your kisses are charity
Your kisses are charity"
"Give me a word

I wish you all the luck I wish you only the best
Satisfaction in love, and true happiness
I wish you blue skies and rainbows, I wish you joy pure and sweet
I wish you all that you wish for, but only if you're with me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I wish you nothin' but trouble if you've decided to leave
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I have had you too long, I have given too much
I have loved you too strong to think of giving you up
I've always envied those lovers that wish you well when you leave
And wish you luck with another; but there are others like me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
And every face you look into, I hope you're haunted by me
Yes, I'm possessive and jealous; at least I speak honestly
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy, never ever ever happy
Never ever ever happy
With anybody but me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I wish you nothin' but trouble if you've decided to leave
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy"
"I can live in a mansion or a double-wide
Eat sushi raw or my catfish fried
Wherever I am, then that's where I belong
'Cause I'm quite content with who I am
And if you ain't, well, kiss my ham
Country is as country does and I'm country to the bone
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I always will be, that's for sure
Country born and country bred
Countrified and country-fed
A country heart and a country head
'Cause I'm country to the core
Now, I can drive a tractor or a Cadillac
I can fly first class or slum in the back
But I'll be the same ol' gal when I arrive
Oh I can wear denim or I can wear silk
Drink champagne or chocolate milk
Take the best or live with less, 'cause a country girl survives
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
And the way I'll be until they lay me low
Country born and country bred
I'm countrified and I'm country-fed
And I'll be that way 'til I'm country dead
'Cause I'm country head to toe
And what you see is what you get
Nothing's ever changed me yet
Nothing will, it's a pretty safe bet
'Cause I'm country through and through
Oh, that's country!
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I'll be until my dying day
I'm country born and country bred
Countrified and country-fed
And nothing done and nothing said can change my country ways
Nothing done and nothing said
Nothing's gonna change my country ways
I don't think so
Wouldn't change if I could
Country is as country does
It's the way I is and it's the way I was
Country born and country bred
I'm countrified and I'm country-fed, you know that
I'm country (she's country)
But now that don't mean I can't go to town!"
"(Dolly Parton)
The greatest gift, the gift of life
The gift of love divine
God gave us all a special gift
He meant for it to shine
He meant for it to shine
The darkest night can be made light
By one bright word or smile
If we'd put on our neighbor's shoes
And choose to walk a mile
God gave us all our own free will
To choose the paths we take
No greater deed could e'er be done
Than for another's sake
The greatest gift, the gift of life
The gift of love divine
God gave us all a special gift
He meant for it to shine
He meant for it to shine
Shine on, shine on, for all to see
God's light inside your soul
Shine on, shine on, let love flow free
Warm others in its glow
Shine on, shine on, shine on
So hide it not or it will fade
Shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on, shine on
The greatest gift, the gift of life
The gift of love divine
God gave us all a special gift
He meant for it to shine
Shine on, shine on, shine on"
"When you live in the country everybody is your neighbor
On this one thing you can rely
They'll all come to see you and they'll never ever leave you
Why'all come to see us bye and bye
Why'all come (y'all come), why'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us when you can
Why'all come (y'all come), why'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us now and then
Now Grandma's a-wishing you'd come out the kitchen
And help do the dishes right away
Then they all start a-leaving, and though she's a-grieving
You can still hear grandma say
Why'all come (y'all come), why'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us when you can
Why'all come (y'all come), why'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us now and then"
"(Dolly Parton)
Someday when I'm over you
And when I think I'm able to
Well, I might try to be
Your friend again
But your restless heart
And rovin' eyes
My jealousy, these endless fights
I've got to get out of your life
Or I will never mend
I guess I'll die a bit each day
But I'm always dying anyway
And I don't have the heart to
Stay, and I can't take the pain
I know we've tried to no avail
Our heaven now has
Turned to hell
The same old hurt
We know so well
And something's got
To change
We both know it's got to end
The passion's gone
It's just pretend
And one of us have got
To make the move
We might as well just give it up
We've lost respect and
There's no trust
And without this, there's
No real love
It's just some sad excuse
I guess I'll die a bit each day
But I'm always dying anyway
And there's nothing left but walk away
Ain't this a crying shame
A change of pace
A change of heart
A change of place
A place to start
And we'll be better off apart
Our only chance is change
And we never wil
But something has to change
But someday when I'm over you
And when I think I'm able to
Then I will try to be your friend again
But I don't want to see
Your face 'til then
Change, I need a change
I need a change
We need a change"
"I can see the sunshine again
And I can see the blue sky where there once was fog and rain
We know each other now clear through and through
The fog has lifted between me and you
I loved you the first time I saw you
For it seemed like I had known you all my life
Well I loved you too but it takes a long time
To know what hurts you what helps you and know how you feel deep inside
I'm so happy you found out before it was too late
Our beautiful love could have turned into hate
Forgiving and understanding gives us a clear view
The fog has lifted between me and you
Now there's the sunshine again..."
"If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my children and my wife
I'd thank my lucky stars
To be living here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.
From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston
And New York to L.A.
Well there's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A."
"Now we don't know what Heaven looks like,
But we've seen enough Hell... right here and right now
But when the road is the roughest,
And the problems are the toughest,
Or when the times are the hardest and that ol' sky turns the darkest,
You gotta keep the faith,
'Cause I believe there's a better day,
And those ol' blues, why there gonna just roll right on away,
I know they are, listen to me.
All this blue, ain't sky and sea,
Some of this blue's bound to get on me,
But the blues, don't come to stay,
They'll move away
On a better day.
Troubles and woes and misery,
Ain't gonna get the best of me,
Lift the shades, fix my gaze,
On a better day
Clear the way
Better days, just up ahead
When sorrow ain't sleepin' in my bed,
When people ain't messin' with my head,
There's a better way,
There's a brighter day,
Oohh there's a better day
With clearer skies
Hope and promise on the rise
Oh the future that is looking bright
On a better day look away, look away
(interlude)
ohh ohh woahh ohh hmmm mmm hmmm
There's a better day
Oh better days, just up ahead
When sorrow ain't sleepin' in my bed,
And people ain't a messin' with my head,
There's a better day,
There's a better day
All of this blue, it ain't sky and sea
some of that blue's gonna to fall on me.
Oh the future's looking bright
There's a better day, look away, look away
Mmmhmmm mmm"
"(Dolly Parton)
She's been there, God knows, she's been there
She has seen and done it all
She's a woman, she know how to
Dish it out or take it all
Her heart's as soft as feathers
Still she weathers stormy skies
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
A kaleidoscope of colors
You can toss her around and round
You can keep her in you vision
But you'll never keep her down
She's a lover, she's a mother
She's a friend and she's a wife
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
Gentle as the sweet magnolia
Strong as steel, her faith and pride
She's an everlasting shoulder
She's the leaning post of life
She hurts deep and when she weeps
She's just as fragile as a child
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies"

Backstory:
Tabloid prediction: Dolly Parton will announce she's falling madly in love with a 300 pound professional wrestler. She'll write a song about their relationship titled ""Headlock on My Heart"" and feature her massive muscleman in the video.
Dolly: Now this actually came out in this magazine. Now, you folks I'm sure buy these every week at the supermarket, right? And you know they never put anything in these magazines that's not true, right? So I figured since I was gonna fall in love anyhow, why wait? So I went out and I found me a 300 pound wrestler and I sat down and I wrote a song called ""Headlock on My Heart"" and I did a video. As a matter of fact, in the same magazine on a page opposite, there was a picture of Hulk Hogan. Now, I love Hulk Hogan. My Daddy's crazy about him, so I called Hulk, I said ""Would you do this?"" 'Cause the song is a fantasy, and it's about a guy named Starlight Starbright. He said ""Aw sure, I'd do anything with you, Dolly!"" I said ""Well, thanks, Hulk, I ought to hug your neck!"" So wouldn't that be something if me and Hulk really wound up getting married? Watch this video...
Song:
The first time that I saw him
Was in a wrestling magazine.
Then I watched him on TV,
Then I bought a ringside seat.
His name was Starlight Starbright,
The greatest in the land.
He sprinkled stardust in my eyes
I was his biggest fan.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Referee: 300 pounds of magic right here in the ring tonight.
Starlight Starbright: Wrestling fans, big and small, who's the greatest of them all?
Dolly: Starlight! Starlight Starbright! Starlight! Starlight Starbright!
He dazzled 'em with brilliance,
He outshined all the rest.
And I loved the heart that beat
Beneath his massive golden chest.
Spoken:
Dolly: In this ring, I thee wed.
Referee: Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
Starlight Starbright: I do!
Referee: And do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
Dolly: I do, I truly do!
Referee: I now pronounce you man and wife.
Dolly: Uh, you may now kiss the bride.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Dolly: Well, it's a whole new arena for me,
But it's a whole new wrestling match for him.
I guess you could say he pinned me down for a lifetime.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart."
"(Dolly Parton)
Chorus:
Love is pretty when love is new
Like a blushing rose in a dazzling dew,
Intoxicating like cherry sweet wine.
When love is new it's magic.
Verse 1:
Mother, oh Mother, why can't you see
He's the only love for me.
Why must thou be opposed to me
I'm asking for thy blessing.
Daughter, oh daughter, I know his kind.
You think he's handsome, you think he's fine.
He'll use your body and tangle your mind;
Too late you'll learn this lesson
Repeat Chorus
When love grows cold, it's tragic
Verse 2:
Mother, oh mother, he's not that way
His touch just takes my breath away.
You surely remember when you felt that way
When you and father first married
Oh, yes, I do remember it well.
What first was heaven soon turned to hell
He left with another the year you were born.
I told you he's dead and buried.
Repeat Chorus
Bridge:
He'll love me true 'cause he told me so.
He'll break you heart when love grows old.
I must go, Mother, I must go.
Then, daughter, why are you asking?
I love him so, I love him so.
Then I pray you're new love's lasting.
Repeat Chorus
Tag:
When love grows cold, it's tragic."
"Today you told me that you'd found another
And you took off your golden wedding band
The one you vowed you'd wear until death do us part
When I kissed it and placed it on your hand
A read will hang upon your door tomorrow
Of the little house that we once called our home
And friends will stop and hang their heads in sorrow
To pay the last respects to one gone on
Tonight I lay me down to sleep forever with this small empty bottle and broken heart
I keep the vow I made I won't forsake it I promised to death do us part
Will you bring your new love to the chapel
To look upon the one that you betrayed
Will you bring me pretty flowers like you used to
And replace them in my hands where I lay
Will you cry and think of happy mem'ries that we shared together at the start
And will you look upon me and remember the dsay we said till death do us part"
"Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us, never molested, though in the wrong
When death has come and taken our loved ones, it leaves our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper living so wicked year after year
Farther along we'll know all about it; farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother; live in the sunshine, we'll understand it all by and by
Faithful till death said our loving master; a few more days to labor and wait
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing as we sweep through the beautiful gates
Farther along we'll know all about it...
Yes, we'll understand it all by and by"
"(Dolly Parton)
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
Just because it feels right does not make it so
So we struggle through life in horns and halos
Tempted and tried with each step we take
We stumble and slide and make our mistakes,
Ask God to forgive us for all of our sins,
Then we take off our horns and wear halos again
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
Just because it feels right does not make it so
So we struggle through life in horns and halos
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
We're praised or we're scorned, we either run or we faint
Oh, but life is a challenge from the day that we're born
Just tryin' to balance halos and horns
It's heaven or hell, halos or horns
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
But just because it feels right; well, that don't make it so
So we struggle through life in horns or halos
It's either horns or halos"
"Chas I cook your a breakfast and send you to work
I mend your clothes Chas I iron your shirts
There's so much thought in each thing that I do
And all of the time Chas I'm loving you
And I greet you each evening Chas when you come home
I miss you so badly while you are gone
And if I make you happy then I'm happy too and all of the time Chas I'm loving you
Chas I rock your babies I teach them to talk
I care for your wife Chas because she can't walk
I do all the things she's unabled to do and all of the time Chas I'm loving you
I want you so much but your wife need you Chas
You'll never be mine and I'll never ask
I know that you love her and I love her too but all of the time Chas I'm loving you
I look at you Chas you look at me but what I am thinking must never be
I love you so much and it's hard to resist
I want you but I I couldn't take you from sis
But all of the time Chas I'm loving you"
"You're late again tonight and I know the reason why
You're out with someone else while I sit home and cry
But I'll just wait right here for you cause I know your new love won't last
I wound easy but I heal fast
This isn't the first time your heart has gone a'stray
You have no resistance when temptation comes your way
But I'll forgive you this time like I've always done in the past
I wound easy but I heal fast
You know that I love you more than anything
And you know that I'll forgive you for causing me this pain
Oh, tonight my heart is breaking but I know this hurt won't last
I wound easy but I heal fast
Yes tonight my heart is breaking but I know this hurt won't last
I wound easy but I heal fast"
"If every time that you got hurt it left a scar
And if every dream you ever had broke your heart
If every time you made a plan the world came to an end
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
If broken dreams are all it seems you've ever known
And hurt's the only thing you can depend upon
And if you should find misery to be your only friend
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
If every time you look up a cloud should hide the sun
Pay dearly for each kindness ever shown to anyone
If everything you try should fail before you can begin
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again"
"Chorus:
Control yourself, control yourself
If you wanna make him care for you, oh
Control yourself, control yourself
Though its gettin' mighty hard to do
I let him tell me all those lies
And then I look into his eyes
And then it begins, I go in a spin
He's the boy that I dreamed about
And now that we are going out, girl you'd better
Repeat Chorus
And when he's holding me so near
He whispers sweet things in my ear
And then it begins, all over again
I just want him to hold me tight
Tell me that everything's alright, girl you'd better
Repeat Chorus
Yeah, its gettin' mighty hard to do
Getting mighty, mighty hard to do
Yeah, its gettin' mighty hard to do
Oh its gettin' mighty hard to do"
"Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far
That I'll lose track
Me, I'll bounce right back
Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine
Me, I'll be just
Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow get me way down
Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew
Maybe I'll just lie low
Maybe I'll hit the bars
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn
Me, I will go on
Maybe I'll settle down
Maybe I'll just leave town
Maybe I'll have some fun
Maybe I'll meet someone
And make him mine
Me, I'll be just
Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
'Cause I'll be fine
(I'll be fine)
Oh, I'll be fine"
"From the start I promised you that I would always be
Waiting here at anytime you ever needed me
I loved you then and I love you now as I always will
And I am always waiting willing to forgive
I'll be your shelter from the storm
My love will keep you safe and warm
I'm a harbor on your stormy sea you can always come to me
For I am always waiting
My arms are always open wide and I will dry the tears you cried
If you should ever need someone darling let it be me
I will mend your broken heart and I'll replace the missing parts
I am always waiting anytime you need me
I'll be your shelter from the storm...
For I am always waiting"
"[Spoken] I've always been misunderstood because of how I look.
Don't judge me by the cover 'cause I'm a real good book.
So read into it what you will, but see me as I am.
The way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam.
I grew up poor and ragged, just a simple country girl.
I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world,
like Barbie or the models in the Fredricks' catalog.
From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all.
I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair.
Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not there.
Don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that
I'm as shallow as I look 'cause I run true and deep.
I'm just a backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels.
I might look artificial, but where it counts I'm real.
Yes, I can see where I may be misjudged upon first glance.
But even backwoods Barbies deserve a second chance.
All dolled up and hopin' for a chance to prove my worth,
'Cuz even backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt."
"Sacred mem'ries often take me to the place where I grew up
And that little country church that I love so much
I used to go there every time that old church bell would ring
And I remember how I love the songs we used to sing
Like oh Lord you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home oh Lord what will I do
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
They were singing Lord I'm coming on when I got saved
And when I got baptized they sang amzaing grace
And oh how sweet the sound when everybody would join in
And sang my favorite song if we never meet again
Where the charming roses bloom forever and where separation comes no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven I will meet you on that beutiful shore
My mama loved to sing and she sang clear and loud
I can close my eyes and I hear mama now
I recall the song my mama always loved so much
She always sang the loudest sangin' power in the blood
Oh there's power power wonder working power in the blood of the lamb
There is power power wonder working power in the precious blood of lamb
Sacred mem'ries"
"(Porter Wagoner & Frank Dycus)
Your trembling hands held me near
Your soft warm lips whispered in my ear
You said you'd always love me
And we'd always be together
And you promised me your love would last forever
Is forever longer than always?
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always?"
"We three kings of Orient are, bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain moor and mountain following yonder star
Born a king on Bethlehem's plain, gold I bring to crown Him again
King forever, ceasing never over us all to reign
Star of wonder, star of night, star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding guide us to Thy perfect light
Frankincense and moor have I, my gift of love and sacrifice
Prayer and praising all men raising worshiping God most high
Oh, star of wonder, star of night, star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding guide us ti Thy perfect light
We three kings of Orient are, bearing gifts we traverse afar,we three kings"
"(Dolly Parton)
When my strength is not enough to face the disapointments
When nothing seems to work out like I planned
When I think I've reached the end, just stop and reassure me
Cause I can make it, if you say I can
If you say I can, then I can find the strength to do it
In knowing you believe that much in me
Tell me that I can and give me faith in what I'm doing
I'm only just as strong as you make me
But I can do it, if you say I can
When I've reached the point of thinking life's not worth the bother
When I can't seem to give what life demands
When it seems impossible to make it any farther
I can go on, if you say I can
If you say I can, then I can find the strength to do it
In knowing you believe that much in me
Tell me that I can and give me faith in what I'm doing
I'm only just as strong as you make me
But I can do it, if you say I can"
"(Traditional)
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
My love, my love, what have I done
To make you treat me so
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
You've caused me to leave my home
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia Line
The engine passed at six o'clock
The caboose went by at nine
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo"
"(Dolly Parton)
A broken heart like a broken wing
It must have its time to mend
I am like a crippled bird
In hopes one day to fly again
I loved you so and I was faithful
I cared more than words could say
But love is cruel and life is hateful
Now you've gone and flown away
Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure
Slow to heal, but quick to cry
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly
Oh, the loss is cold and shameful
And the grief so deep and sharp
There is nothing quite as painful
As a true blue broken heart
Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure
Slow to heal, but quick to cry
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly"
"(Dolly Parton)
When you're not strong and need someone to lean on
Let me be your strength when you're weak
When you need somebody to comfort and love you
Let mine be the arms that you seek
I want to be what you need
Whatever it is, come to me
You'll always know where I'll be
'Cause I want to be what you need
When life gets to be more than you can endure
My hand is always in reach
And I'm always waiting, and I'm always willing
To give you whatever you need
I want to be what you need
Whatever it is, come to me
You'll always know where I'll be
'Cause I want to be what you need
Yes, I want to be what you need"
"I woke up this morning in a strange place
I looked into the mirror at a strange face
Then I looked for you but you could not be found
And then I felt the lonely comin' down
I walked across the room to the empty bed
Saw the imprint on the pillow where you laid your head
The presence of you still lingered all around
And once again I felt the lonely comin' down
Then I felt the lonely dripping down my face
As I realized no one could take your place
I wondered where the love had gone that we had found
And then again I felt the lonely comin' down
I wondered where the love had gone that we had found
And again I felt the lonely comin' down
Mmm..."
"(Dolly Parton)
Well I met a boy from Grassy Branch
Fine as he can be
I met him at the big barn dance
And he took a shine to me
Sky-blue eyes, a big wide smile
And tall as a sycamore tree
He's real smart with a real big heart
And he's gonna marry me
He's gonna marry me
And we're gonna go to town
We're gonna buy some real good car
And we're gonna drive around
We'll hold hands an' touch 'n' hug
He talks so sweet to me
Cause he knows a lot about love and stuff
And he's gonna marry me
His momma don't like me one little bit
But you know I don't care
Let her pitch her hissy-fit
Cause I ain't a'marryin' her
He's always been a momma's boy
It's just plain jealousy
She's as mad as an old wet hen
Cause he's gonna marry me
Oh, an' he's gonna marry me
An' he's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little babe of three
Cause he done kiss me on the mouth
An' he's gonna marry me
Yeah, he's gonna marry me
He's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little babe of three
Cause he's done kiss me on the mouth
So he's gotta marry me
Yeah he's done kiss me on the mouth
And he's gonna marry me

"Go tell it on the mountain over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born
While shepherds kept their watch o'er silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens there shown a holy light
Go tell it on the mountain
The shepherds feared and trembled when low above the earth
Rang out the angel chorus that hailed our Savior's birth
Go tell it on the mountain
Go tell it on the mountain
Go tell it on the mountain"
"(Dolly Parton)
It's Saturday night and it's a perfect night for dancin'
I've had my makeup off and on all day
But it's gotta be right for a night of sweet romancing
And I've combed my hair at least a thousand ways
Mirror Mirror don't you tell a soul
Of how I smiled and talked all day to you
And how I practiced every step I know of
But tonight's the night and I'm a dancing fool
(It's a sure thing) when the sun goes down this evenin'
(It's a sure thing) to be out on the dancing floor
(It's a sure thing) I'll be the last one leavin'
(It's a sure thing) gonna dance till I can't no more
I could of had a date but I thought I'd take my chances
I'm gonna dance with a different guy to every song
Then I'm a gonna wait till the right one strikes my fancy
The he's gonna be the one to dance me home
(It's a sure thing) when the sun goes down this evenin'
(It's a sure thing) to be out on the dancing floor
(It's a sure thing) I'll be the last one leavin'
(It's a sure thing) gonna dance till I can't no more
(It's a sure thing) when the sun goes down this evenin'
(It's a sure thing) to be out on the dancing floor
(It's a sure thing) I'll be the last one leavin'
(It's a sure thing) gonna dance till I can't no more"
"There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road
I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild
Sometimes there is a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Runnin' like a child from these warm stars
Down the seven bridges road
There are stars in the southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time sweet as honey
Down the seven bridges road
There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road
Down the seven bridges road"
"WE'LL GET AHEAD SOMEDAY
Duet by Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner
Writer Mack Magaha
Copyright 1967
We'll get ahead somedays we'll get ahead someday
If the sun comes up and my wife cuts down we'll get ahead someday
Well I get up early work hard all day listen to the troubles of my friends
But I don't realize till I get home whan an awful shape we're in
The car's wore out kids need shoes got a bill from a doctor today
The landlord said you'll get out tomorrow if you don't get me some pay
We'll get ahead someday...
The paper says there's a sale downtown I gotta have some money today
Well there's things at home that's never been used you bought last bargain day
Well you go out one Saturday night just spend too much money on wine
Well I work hard all week long and I gotta have a little fun sometimes
We'll get ahead someday...
If the sun comes up and my wife cuts down we'll get ahead someday"
"They say that it's a matter of trusting
Before love has a chance to begin
And it's never simple
Faithless hearts can cripple
And only a strong love survives
I know they say that it's a fine line
Between giving up and giving in
But once your heart's been in it
You just can't forget it
It's like nothing that you've felt in your life
[Chorus:]
We got real love
Not infatuation
Real love
Our hearts' celebration
I love you
Real love
Not an imitation
Real love
You're my destination
Baby, you and me
We got everything we need
You are such a part of my life
That I can't remember me without you
And we've had our nights
We've had our share of fights
But we've never thought of giving it up
Oh, you and I we must be dreamers
'Cause we're making our dreams come true
I could spend my life
Just holding you so tight
And never, ever get enough
[Chorus]
We got real love
[Repeat Chorus]"
"Baby, won't you come out tonight
Just come up the hill 'cause there's a full moon on the risin'
Hey baby, can't you steal away
You know I really need to see you tonight
I just got word you was packin' it in
What's the matter, this old town got you crazy again
I can see the sad look in your eyes
But I don't know how to say goodbye
And tomorrow, you're gonna have your day
Take your wife and you're gonna run away
Baby, while I'm wailin'
You'll be sailin' like a hog across the bay singin'
Ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Baby, won't you come out tonight
Oh baby, won't you come out tonight
We'll run up the hill and we'll dance in the moonlight
Let me gaze into your eyes 'til we both go blind
Oh baby, can I see you tonight
I'm just tryin' to find a way to make it last
Good friends, they seem to slip away so fast
An' I know we're both headed down separate tracks
An' when ya' go, baby don't look back
There won't be no more sleepin' over on a Tuesday night
No more runnin' to the races for a dark horse at midnight
No more dancin' after hours, singin' in the showers
Or clingin' to each other in the soft mornin' light singin'
Ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
I'll meet ya' on the corner
And you'll be there at midnight
Oh baby, can you steal away
You know I really want to see ya' tonight
Ooo baby, can you come out tonight
We'll run up the hill and dance again in the moonlight
Oh baby, can you steal away
I really wanna see you tonight
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
Come up the hill, there's a full moon on the rise
Oh baby, can ya' steal away
Baby, won't ya' come out tonight"
"(Though I'm only second best you're still first with me)
I tried to make you love me I've done everything I could
I thought if I tried long enough maybe someday that you would
But there was someone else before me and it's her you're lovin' still
And I know no matter what I'd do I'm only second best
Only second best that's all I will ever be
Even though I'm second best you're still first with me
And I'll be loving you when they fall my hand I guess
I love you even though I know I'm only second best
I know you've tried to love me and I'd hope you would in time
I know that when you're holding me it's her that's on your mind
Now I know you can't get over her but I love you nonless
But it makes no difference what I'd do I'm only second best
Only second best...
I love you even though I know I'm only second best"
sometimes we feel the power of gods great hands are failed by some not worthy while those who sing and praise god's name seem to be passed by but worthy or not god loves us all or even a little bird that couldn't fly why is life given and taken away to soon for some to tell and others live for many years and walk a path to hell a cripple at birth may speak gods name and tender tongues with pain while a man with hell ends well or take gods name in vein but gods reasons may not be known or questioned by me and you like the little bird i saw like the bird that never flew i feel close to each name god made the earth the sky the sea and each creature living here belongs to him even you and me and one day when i was walking along i saw some of gods beautiful things by the path by which i walked i saw a small bird that had no wings so i sat down and held out my hand and that little bird climbed on and i held him for a long long time i thought that maybe his mom might come and he looked at me and thought he might of found him a friend for a bird that never flew so i built him a house on the ground like a few birds i've ever know and he seemed to be so happy there with some friends he knew and his new home and for two years i watched and fed him as with the other birds he played but when they got tired they just flew away then i looked at the loneliness in his eyes and watched the birds fly into the blue but then i look at understandience though he knew why he couldn't do that to and then one summary evening at sunset i saw a perfect picture of love each one of his playmates where beautiful white doves then the ruffle of their feathers as they started into flight but then i noticed all but one dove was fine but he looked like my bird but he had wings solid gold and new but then i knew it was my bird the little bird that never flew until then
"He's got a way of walking he's got a way of talking
A way to fascinate me all the time
And he's got a way with women a way to keep my head a swimming
He's got a way too many times
Oh speaking of the devil well here he comes now
Looking like an angel got my defenses down
He's got me dreaming got me scheming
Ooh speaking of the devil he is driving me wild
With that wicked little grin and that fire in his eyes
He's got me dreaming got me scheming
Ooh speaking of the devil it feels mighty close to heaven
And I'd go through hell to make him mine
He's got his spell upon me got to be his one and only
Burning with passion and desire
Ooh I'm caught up in all his magic it surely would be tragic
To never share the heat in all his fire
Ooh speaking of the devil well here he comes now...
[ guitar ]
Ooh speaking of the devil well here he comes now..."
"(Dolly Parton)
Got a crazy, restless feelin'
I cannot be consoled
Got an itchy urge to up and run
I think I've lost control
You do something to me
Something that I really can't explain
I ain't felt like this since I'ze a kid
And I never thought I'd feel this much again
I've got that runaway feelin'
Like to grab you up
Just run off, footloose and fancy free
Yeah, that thought's appealing
That runaway feelin's let my feelin's run away with me
I get all swimmy-headed everytime I look at you
Though love has blurred my vision, I still enjoy the view
Like Elvis and his hound dog, in a deep fog
I keep a'runnin' after you
I thought I'd been in love before
But before doesn't matter anymore
I've got that runaway feelin'
Like to grab you up
Just run off, footloose and fancy free
Yeah, that thought's appealing
That runaway feelin's let my feelin's run away with me
Ah, run with it, boys
I've got that runaway feelin'
Like to grab you up
Just run off, footloose and fancy free
Yeah, that thought's appealing
That runaway feelin's let my feelin's run away with me
I've got that runaway feelin' (runaway)
Runaway feelin' (runaway)
Won't you run away with me"
"He's got a way of walkin'
He's got a way of talkin'
A way to fascinate me all the time
And he's got a way with women
A way to keep my head a swimmin'
He's got away too many times
Chorus:
Ooh, speakin' of the devil
Well, here he comes now
Lookin' like an angel
Got my defenses down
He's got me dreamin'
Got me schemin'
Ooh, speakin' of the devil
He is drivin' me wild
With that wicked little grin
And that fire in his eyes
He's got me dreamin'
Got me steamin'
Ooh, speakin' of the devil
It feels mighty close to heaven
And I'd go through hell to make him mine
He's got his spell upon me
Got to be his one and only
Burning with passion and desire
Ooh, I'm caught up in all his magic
It surely would be tragic
To never share the heat
From all this fire

"Sugar pie honey bunch you know that I love you
I can't help myself I love you and nobody else
Wanna tell in and out my life you come and go
Leaving just your picture behind
and I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your finger or wink your eye I come a running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings and there's nothing I can do
Sugar pie honey bunch I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you tell you that we're through and I've tried
But every time I see your face I get all choked up inside
When I call your name girl it starts the flame burning in my heart
tearin it all apart no matter how I try my love
I cannot hide 'cause"
"Du-u-u Du-u-u Du-u-u-u-u-u wa Du-u wa
My love for you is deeper than the depths of any ocean,
And as faithful as the stars that grace the night,
As constant as the sun making its journey through heavens,
and we'll always be together you and I.
--
[Chorus]
Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine.
Paint a pretty rainbow, brushed with love across the sky,
Together you and I belong, like a songbird and a song
and we'll always be together you and I
--
Life with you is sweeter than the fragrance of the flowers
And as happy as the laughter of a child
As peaceful as a river and as lasting as forever
you know we'll always be together you and I
[Chorus]
I always be beside or close behind you.
Wherever you go, you'll always know I'll always find you
[Chorus]
We'll always be together, you and I
Forever together, forever you and I
(forever you and I du-du)
Forever together, together you and I will always be
(together, together)
Together, you and I........"
"Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You say our love is over that you have found another
You say you're goin' away but leave me tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You've hurt me enough today I can't believe the words you say
I must accept the fact you won't be coming back
So stay just one more day loneliness isn't far away
Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today"
"A cross between a movie star
And a hero in a book
Romeo comes struttin' in
And everybody looks
'Cause he's just got that special thang
That everybody needs
And everybody wants him
But not as bad as me
Hey, Romeo, where art thou
Get out here on the floor
I want to dance you darlin'
'Til you forget wherefore
Let's two step to a new step
We'll keep it all in line
And we'll call this the Romeo
'Cause you're so mighty fine
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo come dance with me
And that sexy little body
Beats all I've ever seen
I ain't never seen a cowboy
Look that good in jeans
My temperature keeps risin'
Every time we meet
I may not be in love
But let me tell you
I'm in heat
Romeo, Romeo, I just know I'll get you yet
Romeo, Romeo, I want to be your Juliet
So step it high, step it low
Step it out and in
Step to the side and let it slide
Then steppin' up again
Step on toes, it all goes
Steppin' as you please
But I'm one step away from love
So don't step out on me
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo with the magic feet
So step it high, step it low
Step it out and in
Step to the side and let it slide
Then steppin' up again
Step on toes, it all goes
Steppin' as you please
But I'm one step away from love
So don't step out on me
Romeo, Romeo
I just know I'll get you yet
Romeo, Romeo
Won't you be my Juliet

Red, white and bluegrass, red, white and blue
Red, white and blue ooh-ooh-ooh
Red, white and blue"
"You're late again tonight and I know the reason why
You're out with someone else while I sit home and cry
But I'll just wait right here for you cause I know your new love won't last
I wound easy but I heal fast
This isn't the first time your heart has gone a'stray
You have no resistance when temptation comes your way
But I'll forgive you this time like I've always done in the past
I wound easy but I heal fast
You know that I love you more than anything
And you know that I'll forgive you for causing me this pain
Oh, tonight my heart is breaking but I know this hurt won't last
I wound easy but I heal fast
Yes tonight my heart is breaking but I know this hurt won't last
I wound easy but I heal fast"
"(Dolly Parton)
Oh look at you boy, look at them jeans
Cutest little buttfull I've ever seen
I'd like to find you under my tree
Whatcha tryin' to do to me, huh?
Hey look at them boots, look at that hat
You can get in big trouble lookin' like that
Flirtin' like mad, talkin' that trash
You could make a good girl go bad real fast
Chorus:
Whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do anyhow
I ain't made of steel but if looks could kill
Well I'd 've been dead by now
Tell me whatcha tryin to do to me
Look at that smile, look at them eyes
All lit up like Christmas lights
When you land on my roof tonight
Well here's what you better be
Well you'd better be fit, you'd better be prime
Cause I'm gonna ring your Christmas chime
When you climb down my chimney
Do whatcha you know only you can do to me
Repeat Chorus
I said ooh, what a thrill but if looks could kill
Well I'd 've been dead by now
Tell me whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do to me"
"(Dolly Parton)
When I was a child I recall and old man; everybody loved old Zeke
He was all alone, his family was gone; one day he said to me
I'm just sittin' here thinkin' about Jesus, rockin' as my old chair creaks
Some glad day I'll fly away when Jesus comes calling for me
It might be today, it might be tomorrow, maybe one day next week
I'll soon be done with trouble and sorrow when He comes calling for me
When Jesus comes calling for me
When I die don't grieve and cry
Lordy, don't feel sorry for me
Oh what a day, what a mighty fine day
When Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me
I might be in the graveyard walking talking to my family
Or I might be plowing in the field down yonder, just old Muley and me
Wherever I am, whatever I'm a doing, some sweet day I'll see
And band of angels in a cloud of glory when Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me
When I die just close my eyes
And lay me 'neath the willow tree
Oh what a day, what a mighty fine day
When Jesus comes calling for me
When Jesus comes calling for me
I'm just sittin' here watchin' for Jesus, rockin' as my old chair creaks
Some sweet day I'll fly away when Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me"
"Letra de Lover Du Jour -
""Lover Du Jour""
What are you looking at, lover boy?
It won't do you any good
Cause I know your kind
If you wanna be mine
We gotta get this understood
Oh, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
Your special off the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in the hell for you, for sure
If you think I will be, I'll be your lover du jour
I'm what? (Lover du jour) Not me!
I am well aware of your good looks and se*y ways
Serving up yourself to girls to satisfy your taste
The fresh catch of the day on your Romeo buffet
Served up hot and ready just having it your way
Well, if I'm on the menu, you'd better get this straight (Lover du jour)
Me and you had better come to terms before you grab your plate
Don't need one place to order if you believe that I
I'm just some cheesy little dish, just another chickie pie
Oh, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
The flavor of the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in the hell that I'll endure
The fact that I would only be your lover du jour
Oubliez-moi! Forget me!
Still looking, lover boy?
Have you changed your view?
I told you once, I'll say it again
I'll take no merit from you!
That's crap!
If you want something appetizing
Something real and satisfying
I'll be worth a second look, but that's the only way!
Cause, I'm not gonna be your, be your l'amour du jour
Your playmate of the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Cause I won't be caught up in all your charm and your allure
No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
The special off the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in the hell that I'll endure
The fact that I would only be your lover du jour
No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
Your lover du jour
No, I am not for your amusement
I am not a toy, you are nothing but trouble
You are a bad bad boy! (l'amour du jour)
I am a tasty starter around a full course meal
Desert half after dinner drink, and you can have no feel...
Pardon my French ...
Any questions?
Ugh, my French is awful but my love is awesome
They gonna laugh at me in France, sorry..."
"As I sit here tonite the jukebox's playin
The song about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words they are saying
It brings memories when I was a trusted wife
It was not God who made Honky Tonk Angels
As you said in the words of you're song
Too many times married men think, they're still single
And that's why many a poor girl do go wrong
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame
It was not God who made HTA
As you said in the words of you're song
Too many times married men think, they're still single
And that's why many a poor girl do go wrong"
"Peace in the valley for me some day
Well, I'm tired and so weary, but I must travel on
'Til the Lord comes and calls me away, oh, yes
Where the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night is as bright as the day, oh, yes
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
Only peace in the valley for me, oh, yes
Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh, yes
And the beasts from the wild shall be led by a little child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh, yes"
"The fisherman are pitching pennies in the sand beside the sea
And the sunrise hits their oilskin boots, their painted boats and me
And they seem to know the ocean like a man knows a woman
She makes him wait around for half the morning for the tide to turn
[Chorus]
Pull on the ropes, seine haul fisherman
Never catches more than he knows he can sell in a day
Pull in the nets, seine haul fisherman
Day's for work, night's the time to go dancing
They're drinking beer and laughing and squinting at the sun
Waiting for the gulls to tell them when the fish will come
Their faces brown and weathered from all the nets they've run
They've learned to wait, they always know that the tide will turn
[Chorus]
Now way out on the ocean the big ships hunt for whales
And the Japanese have caught so many now they hunt for snails
But my fisherman's not greedy he seems content to live
With the sun and the sand and a net full of fishes when the tide turns
[Chorus]
Oh, yes pull on the ropes, seine haul fisherman
Never catches more than he knows he can sell in a day
Oh, and pull in the nets, seine haul fisherman
Day's for work, night's the time to go dancing"
"Tonight i feel a chill in the air
As cold as that look on your face
I hear what you're saying but coming from you
Goodbye seems so out of place
Now how can you stand there and honestly say
There never wee any real promises made
[Chorus]
The moon is my witness
The stars will agree
They all heard you promise
You'd always love me
I know that it's true
But it's hard to believe
You lied to the moon
The stars and me
And what about all of those warm tender nights
Did they mean nothing to you
And where are the feelings i thought that we shared
Or have you forgotten them too
Did you think i could just put your memory behind
When your words are still so very clear in my mind
[Chorus:Repeat x2]"
"(B. Tosti/R. O'Hearn)
He takes the train into the city
To him it's more than just a working day
Cause he knows he can change the world in his ordinary way
She's got a job, she has a family
She tries to keep them both together
She's barely getting by, saving everything she makes
Day by day it seems it's getting harder to win
How much longer, ready for their ship to come in
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the working man
Trying to survive, staying alive, giving it all that he can
With a fire in his soul that keeps burning
And a dream in her heart that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life
They started out as high school sweethearts
He promised her a life of luxury
And though they don't have riches they have everything they need
The eyes of her child are her diamonds
The gift of his love are her pearls
Together they plan, taking a stand to make this a better world
But never breaking, knowing that their dreams will begin
Getting stronger in each other's arms
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the modern world
There's a spirit inside that keeps us alive, giving it all that we can
With a fire in our soul that keeps burning
And a dream in our hearts that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life
Everybody has a special reason
There's a chosen road to follow
Just remember nothing good comes easy
Don't surrender till you you find your rainbow
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the working man
Trying to survive, staying alive, giving it all that he can
With a fire in his soul that keeps burning
And a dream in her heart that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the modern world
There's a spirit inside that keeps us alive, giving it all that we can
With a fire in our soul that keeps burning
And a dream in our hearts that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life"
"Well, I think it's fine buildin' jumbo planes
Or takin' a ride on a cosmic train
Switch on a summer from a slot machine
Yes, you can get what you want, if you want it
'Cause you can get anything
I know we've come a long way
We're changin' day to day
But tell me where do the children play?
Well, you roll on roads over fresh green grass
With your heavy loads pumping petrol gas
And you make 'em long and you make 'em tough
And you just go on and on and it seems you can't get off
I know we've come a long way
We're changin' day to day
But tell me where do the children play?
Crack the sky, scrapers fill the air
But you keep on buildin' higher
'Til there's no more room up there?
Will you make us laugh?
Will you make us cry?
Will you tell us when to live?
Will you tell us when to die?
I know we've come a long way
We're changin' day to day
But tell me where do the children play?
Tell me where do the children play?
Well, I think it's fine buildin' jumbo planes
Or takin' a ride on a cosmic train
But, where do the children play?
Just tell me where do the children play?"
"Well, I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
Saying something about a queen
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at mother nature on the run
In the twentieth century
Look at mother nature on the run
In the twentieth century
I was lying in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eye
I was hoping for replacement
When the sun burst through the sky
There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like I could cry
I was thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There was children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream, the loading had begun
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home"

The dirt was clay and was the color of the blood in me
A twelve acre farm on a ridge is southern Tennessee
We left that sweat all over that land behind a mule we watched grow old
Row after row trying to grow corn and cotton on ground so poor that grass won't
Grow
There was one old store in the hollow we all called town
It belonged to a gentle old man named Henry Brown
He gave us credit in the wintertime so we could live through the cold when the
Wind brought snow
Trying to grow corn and cotton on ground so poor that grass won't grow
The one I loved walked through those fields with me
She was a hard working woman true as one could be
But then one year death was going 'round and swiftly took it's toll
Janie had to go
Now she lies asleep under ground so poor that grass won't grow
As I stand here looking over this part of Tennessee
The fields are bare as far as the eye can see
And over the grave where Janie lies there's a beautiful sight to behold
And no one knows why there's flowers blooming on ground so poor that grass
Won't grow"
"A light shines from my window
I just can't sleep no more
Lord, it hurts so much to be alone
But the real men never do admit
That it's them that might be wrong
At least that's what he told me in his song
He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind
The freedom that he sings about
I guess I'll never know
I just can't shake the guilt or kill the pain
But he lets me ride when the lights turns low
Get on board the radio and take a ride to Texas on his train
He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind"
"Give me a word

Oh, Heaven let your light shine down
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down

Love is in the water
Love is in the air

And tell me will love be there, will love be there

I just came by to let you know
I'll never ever let you go, oh my
Ooo-eee my love
And if you ever, ever stray
I know that that will be the day
That I die, oh my
Ooo-eee my love
Ooo-eee, ooo-eee my baby
Ooo-eee my baby

I've been around the world a bit
But you're the best thing I've seen yet, oh my

We might be at it until dawn, oh my
Ooo-eee my love
Ooo-eee, ooo-eee my baby

Hey baby
You see where I've been and you know where I'm going

Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll fly away to you, if only pretending
We'll be like bluebirds do, the beautiful lie
The beautiful lie, the beautiful lie
Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll find my way to you, if I'm only pretending
And we'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie
We'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie"
"(Dolly Parton)
Don't ask me if I'm crying
Can't you see it ain't raining
No, this ain't sand in my eyes
Before it has been spoken
When one good heart gets broken
That's enough to make a cowgirl cry
Cause here I am, all by myself
My man he just up and left
He said he would never try again
Now the thing that hurts me most
When he makes up his mind to go
He'll be gone, like a wild texas wind
Chorus:
Like a wild texas wind
Oh my man is gone again
I feel lonesome settin' in
Like a wild texas wind
Like a Wild Texas Wind
Oh my man is gone, he's gone, he's gone again
I feel lonesome sittin' in
Like a wild texas wind
Hmmmm"

Chorus:
I'm the queen of the sleazy tabloids
I rule the trashy kingdom
Like Lady Di they make sure I am never left alone
Papparazzi and reporters stalk me from the shadows
Making sure to keep my royal assetts on my throne
Oh they talk about the lovers
That I keep undercover
And I wish that I was as much fun
As they have you believe
Just like Alec Baldwin
I'd love to whack 'em all one
But instead I'll wait and see
Who I am sleepin' with next week
I'm the queen of the sleazy tabloids
And I rule the trashy kingdom
But the rumors raise my cue score
And pay for my big home
I guess I 'augt to sue them
But instead I guess I'll use them
To keep me in the spotlight
And keep me on my throne
Cause I'm the queen of the sleazy tabloids"
"Somebody's missing you
Longs to be kissing you
You'd better listen
You mean all the world to me
You're on somebody's mind
Just almost all the time
Bet you already knew
Somebody's missing you
The days go slowly by
When I'm away from you
I long to see your smile
And feel the warmth of you
I've loved you for so long
But still we feel brand new
At home, inside your arms
Somebody's missing you
Somebody's missing you
Longs to be kissing you
You'd better listen
You mean all the world to me
You're on somebody's mind
I hope you miss me too
Somebody's missing you
Last thought before I sleep
First thought when I awake
You're even in my dreams
And I can hardly wait
To hear your voice again
Saying all the things you do
In case you're wondering
Somebody's missing you
Somebody's missing you
Longs to be kissing you
You'd better listen
You mean all the world to me
You're on somebody's mind
Just almost all the time
I know you know I do
Somebody's missing you
In case you're wondering
Somebody's missing you
Really, really, really, really missing you"

"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.
Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight."
"The city streets are empty, it's beginning to feel like dawn
The lights have gone out, the sun is coming on
We've been standing here for hours watching the river flow
You walked into my life tonight but if you've got to go
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
I've been saving all my secrets, spending my time alone
I've given up on the life I used to know
I've been waiting for one person to love me like a friend
You walked into my life tonight but if it's got to end
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
Oh, it's easy now to tell you how I'm dreaming 'bout tomorrow
Cause you'll be there to share that dream with me
But now it's time to close your eyes put this night away
And keep it safe, a perfect memory
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
Oh, oh, oh
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a little while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but don't you say goodbye
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while"
"They say a woman's a fool for weeping
A fool to break her own heart
But I can't hold the secret I'm keeping
I'm breaking apart
Can't seem to mind my own business
Whatever I try turns out wrong
I seem like my own false witness
And I can't go on
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies
You told me you needed my company
And I believed in your flattering ways
You told me you needed me forever
Nearly gave you the rest of my days
Should've seen you for what you are
Should never have come back for more
Should've locked up all my silver
Brought the key right to your door
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies
You don't know what a chance is
Until you have to seize one
You don't know what a man is
Until you have to please one
Don't put your life in the hands of a man
With a face for every season
Don't waste your time in the arms of a man
Who's no stranger to treason
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies"
"Two people, together
It was just a dream until you came along
My heart was waiting just for you
Tomorrow, forever
We both heard these promises for far too long
And now you make the words come true
So touch me now
I need to have you close tonight
And show me how
You can me feel this way
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key
Can't keep it, a secret
Everything I feel is written on my face
I can't hide my heart from you
You hold me, is magic
In your arms the world becomes a better place
Now I know what love can do
Here we go
Exactly where the road will lead us
I don't know
I just know that you'll be there
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key
And whenever you, I'm there
Every stumble and fall, I share
I'll be yours through it all
Coz I care, about you baby
It's so easy to see, so strong
Now I know you and me, belong
I'll be by your side forever....
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key"

A little white house with black wooden shadows
A porch with its columns all covered with vine
My broken dream house where he lives with another
But this was supposed to be mine
Two little children that look like their daddy
With the same smile and the same eyes that shine
The only thing wrong I'm not their mommy
But they were supposed to be mine
He's given to her what he promised to me
The plans that we made never can be
For each night he holds and carresses another
And she is supposed to be me
He's given to her what he promised to me
The plans that we made never can be
For each night he holds and carresses another
And she is supposed to be me"
"(Porter Wagoner)
He walks in my mind like a shadow
Someone speaks his name and he appears
I can see his face in total darkness
Oh, he's everywhere
He left a memory that lives with me
A memory of how it used to be
And I remember all the things we used to share
Oh, he's everywhere
He waits in the corners of my mind
And in the stillness of the night, he walks around
Sometimes his memory's so real I think he's really there
Oh, he's everywhere
He left a memory that lives with me
A memory of how it used to be
I remember all the things we used to share
Oh, he's everywhere
Oh, he's everywhere"
"(Dolly Parton)
Raindrops tumble to the ground
Making puddles all around
Drops of rain that look like tears
Fall on my window pane
Raindrops seem to harmonize
With teardrops falling from my eyes
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
Steady as the rain they fall
Tears that just won't dry at all
Tears that cannot wash away the pain
Sometimes without knowing it
I touch my face and find it wet
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
I can't face the fact that
I am not important in your life
Once you lived for rollin' me
And then your feelings changed
There's just no gettin' over you
I try so hard, but it's no use
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
Raindrops just keep falling down
Beatin' out their rhythmic sounds
Dancin' as they play their sweet refrain
Memories of you cloud my mind
Cloud my eyes and I start cryin'
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
As steady as the rain
Steady as the rain they fall
Tears that just won't dry at all
Tears that just won't wash away the pain
Memories of you cloud my mind
Cloud my eyes and I start cryin'
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
As steady as the rain"
"As we were dressing to go out our little girl and boy
Came in and asked if they could go this time
We told them little girls and boys don't belong at parties
And that they should be in bed asleep by nine
The babysitter came in then and we kissed the kids goodbye
And told them that we'd be home soon and told them not to cry
Then we left for the party like we'd so often done
Thinking only of ourselves and not our little ones
The party started out wild and it grew wilder as the night wore on
With drinking laughing telling dirty jokes nobody thinkin' of home
Then the strangest feeling came over me and it chilled me to the bones
And I told my wife that we'd better leave the party
Cause I felt that we were needed at home
As we rode along I got to thinking of how the kids that morning
Had asked if we would take them to church the next day
And how I'd put 'em off like I'd so often done
By saying we'd probably get home too late
Then my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of sirens
As they cut through the still night air
Then we turned down our street that's when we saw the fire
The rest was like a nightmare
We took their little bodies to church the next day
Though we'd left the party early we still got home too late"
"(Dolly Parton)
When you love somebody with all your heart and soul
And you want to keep them with you, but you know they want to go
What do you do, what do you say
When you know they want to leave
As bad as you want them to stay
And there's nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love
When one doesn't care at all and the other cares too much
It's a sad situation, I must say
When you know they want to leave
As bad as you want them to stay
You know how much I love you
But I know you don't love me
And I know it's just a matter of time before you leave
But I do, I stand aside and just let you walk away
But I know you want to leave
As bad as I want you to stay"
"I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You think you know the smile on her lips
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You think you'll find heaven of bliss
In each caress, in each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You stole her love from me one day
You didn't care, oh, it hurt me
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be.
You think she's yours, to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn, when her love grows cold
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her."

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
I hear he's gone to some far country
And that he cares no more for me
I wish I were a swallow flying
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place
I'd join the wild birds in their crying
Thinking of you and your sweet face
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
But now the stars have turned against me
And he cares no more for me
Oh when the dark is on the mountain
And all the world has gone to sleep
I will go down to the cold dark waters
And there I'll lay me down and weep
Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me"
"Soft as the voice of an angel, breathing a lesson unheard
Hope with a gentle persuasion whispers her comforting word
Wait till the darkness is over, wait till the tempest is gone
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow, after the shower is gone
Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice
Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice"
"The crops are all in and the peaches are rotting
The oranges are piled in their creosote dumps
You're flying them back to the Mexican border
To pay all their money to wade back again
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis a-mi-gos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be deportee
Some of us are illegal and some of us are not wanted
Our work contract's out and we have to move on
But it's 600 miles to that mexican border
They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like thieves
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis a-mi-gos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be deportee
My father's own father, waded that river
They took all the money he made in his life
My brothers and sister come work the fruit trees
They rode the truck til' they took down and died
The airplane caught fire over Los Gatos canyon
A fireball of lightning that shook all our hills
Who are these dear friends all scattered like dry leaves
The radio said they were just deportees
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis a-mi-gos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be deportee
No, all they will call you will be deportee
All they will call you will be deportee"
"Well the two new people that's moved to the middle of the block
And we're at the top of the town and don't you think we're not
Well we found love and happiness people envy us you see
For we found heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33
Yes we found what most people are looking for
And it's not a lotta money to spend on real fine car
But it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
And there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 4-0-33
Four thousandth block proves what true love can do
Once a lonely place but was sold to me and you
Oh all around the house you can see little children play
But they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
They are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
They're a part of heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33
[ steel - el.banjo ]
Our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
For look at the house they think there from the sky
They think this place would make them as happy as you and me
And the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 4-0-33
Four thousandth block proves what true love can do...
And we're not gonna sale our happy little house at 4-0-33
Wouldn't take a pretty thing for the love we had at 4-0-33"
"You never close your eyes anymore
When I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness
Like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it, baby
But baby, baby
I know it
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa...
Now there's no welcome look
In your eyes when I reach for you
And now you're starting to
Criticize little things I do
It makes me just feel like crying, baby
'Cause baby,
Something beautiful is dying
You lost that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa
Baby, baby,
I get down on my knees
And pray to you
If you would only love me
Like you used to do
We had a love, a love,
A love you don't find everyday
So don't, don't, don't
Don't let it slip away
Bring back that lovin' feeling
Oh, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on, whoa...
You've lost the lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost the lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Bring back that lovin' feeling,
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone"
"Darling will your love be mine forever always always
Will you keep those vows we made together always always
Will your love be as strong
If my dreams should all go wrong always always
Darling will you stay with me forever always always
Will your love remain through stormy weather always always
Will your love be strong enough
To walk the roads that might get rough always always
In return for your love I'll be true as stars above always always
And the love that I feel will forever be so real always always"
"(Bill Owens)
I'm running out of love and I'm running out of patience
You seem to get worse every day
I'm running out of love, better learn to resist temptation
Or someday you'll wake up and I'll be far away
How long did you think you could keep on doing me wrong
How long did you think I'd stay quiet and take it
The love I had for you is almost gone
And I ain't gonna let you take my heart and break it
I'm running out of love and I'm running out of patience
You seem to get worse every day
I'm running out of love, better learn to resist temptation
Or someday you'll wake up and I'll be far away
You come and go just any time you want to
And you never bother to tell me where your going
And I wonder if there's anything you don't do
Someday you'll pay for the wild seed your sewing"
"(Porter Wagoner)
When your heart feels like a feather in a whirlwind
And you see stars in the middle of the day
And you feel so light you could fly
And you think that any moment the slightest breeze might blow you away
That's love you're feeling
That's love with feeling
Touching, tender love inside your soul
That's love you're feeling
This love with feeling
That takes you away on love wings of solid gold
When you're all alone
And each minute seems like eternity
As thoughts of love come rushing through your mind
In the middle of the night
You feel it kiss you while your alone
Don't be alarmed its only this love of mine
That's love you're feeling
That's love with feeling
Touching, tender love inside your soul
That's love you're feeling
Oh, that's love with feeling
That takes you away on love wings of solid gold"
"(Dolly Parton)
Stand back, and give me room
And listen to that beat
I got the music in my soul
And the rhythm in my feet
When I hear the music
You won't catch me standing still
And I won't miss a beat
I never have and I never will
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
I can dance to anything
That any band can play
I've got old-fashioned values
But I'm pretty up to date
And I know all the latest hits
On the radio
You don't have to join me
Stand back and watch my show
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
Thought I couldn't dance
Hey, watch me prance
Let's make romance
Thought I couldn't dance
You gotta take a chance
If you're gonna learn to dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
There's a lot of closet dancers
Just dyin' to come out
They dance alone inside their rooms
With the music way up loud
And I know you thought I couldn't dance
But I guess I sure fooled you
It just goes to show you never know
Who's wearing dancin' shoes
And you thought I couldn't dance
I'm full of surprises
And you thought I couldn't dance
It's too late now
I can't slow down...can't slow down
Oh, feel the heat
From these dancin' feet... can't slow down
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
Repeat..."
"(Dolly Parton)
I know this dress I'm wearing doesn't hide the secret I've tried concealing
When he left he promised me he'd be back by the time it was revealing
The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow o'er the fields of clover
And time is running out for me, I wish that he would hurry down from Dover
He's been gone so long, when he left the snow was deep upon the ground
And I have seen a spring and summer pass and now the leaves are turning brown
At any time a tiny face will show itself 'cause waiting's almost over
But I won't have a name to give it if he doesn't hurry down from Dover, from Dover, from Dover
My folks weren't understanding, when they found out they sent me from the home place
My daddy said if folks found out he'd be ashamed to ever show his face
My mamma said I was a fool, she did not believe it when I told her
Momma, everything's gonna be all right 'cause soon he would be coming down from Dover
I found a place to stay out on a farm takin' care of that old lady
She never asked me nuthin' so I never talked to her about my baby
I sent a messgae to my mom with a name and address of Ms. ol' Grover
And to make sure he got that information when he came down from Dover
I loved him more than anything and I could not refuse him when he needed me
He was the only one I'd loved and I just can't believe that he was usin' me
He wouldn't leave me here like this, I know it can't be so, it can't be over
He wouldn't make me go through this alone, he'll be coming down from Dover
My body aches the time is here it's lonely in this place where I'm lying
Our baby has been born, but something's wrong, it's too still, I hear no crying
I guess in some strange way she knew she'd never have a father's arms to hold her
So dying was her way of tellin' me he wasn't coming down from Dover, from Dover, from Dover
Down from Dover"
"Ah, now I don't hardly know her
But I think I could love her
Crimson and clover
Ah when she comes walking over
Now I've been waitin' to show her
Crimson and clover over and over
Yeah, my, my such a sweet thing
I wanna do everything
What a beautiful feeling
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over"
"There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road
I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild
Sometimes there is a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Runnin' like a child from these warm stars
Down the seven bridges road
There are stars in the southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time sweet as honey
Down the seven bridges road
There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road
Down the seven bridges road"
"If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my children and my wife
I'd thank my lucky stars
To be living here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.
From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston
And New York to L.A.
Well there's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A."

I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
You say that wasn't you I saw with someone else last night
You say you've never done me wrong you've always treated me right
I know it was dark but not that dark and I'm not that blind
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I'm fed up with you and the way that you do
I used to love you now I change my mind
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I once believed everything you've said I was so in love with you
You said I was the only one now I know that wasn't true
Now I know just where I stand I'm tidin' your cheatin' line
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I'm fed up with you...
I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line"

Is Forever Longer Than Always Dolly Parton lyrics
Artist: Dolly Parton
Album: Heartsongs: Live From Home
Year: 1994
Your trembling hands held me near
Your soft warm lips whispered in my ear
You said you'd always love me
And we'd always be together
And you promised me your love would last forever
Is forever longer than always?
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always?
Dolly Parton Lyrics"
"(Dolly Parton)
She's been there, God knows, she's been there
She has seen and done it all
She's a woman, she know how to
Dish it out or take it all
Her heart's as soft as feathers
Still she weathers stormy skies
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
A kaleidoscope of colors
You can toss her around and round
You can keep her in you vision
But you'll never keep her down
She's a lover, she's a mother
She's a friend and she's a wife
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
Gentle as the sweet magnolia
Strong as steel, her faith and pride
She's an everlasting shoulder
She's the leaning post of life
She hurts deep and when she weeps
She's just as fragile as a child
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies"
"(Dolly Parton)
Well a good ways down the railroad track
There was this little old rundown shack
And in it lived a man I'd never seen
Folks said he was a mean and a vicious man
And you better not set foot on his land
I didn't think nobody could be that mean
So I took me out walking down the railroad track
I was a-gonna go down to that little old shack
And just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
There was a big black dog laying out in the yard
And it growled at me and I swallowed hard
And I heard somebody say well who are you
Oh and there he stood in the door of that shack
His beard and his hair was long and black
And he was the biggest man I'd ever seen
When he spoke his voice was low and deep
But he just didn't frighten me
'Cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean
He said what you doing snooping 'round my place
And I saw a smile come across his face
So I smiled back and I told him who I was
He said come on in and pull you up a chair
You might as well since you already here
And he said you can call me Joshua
Joshua Joshua
Whatcha doing living here all alone
Joshua Joshua
Ain't you got nobody to call your own
No no no no
We talked 'til the sun was clean out of sight
And we still talking when it come daylight
And there was just so much we had to say hey
I'd spent my life in an orphan's home
And just like him I was all alone
So I said yeah when he asked if I'd stay
Oh we grew closer as time went on
And that little old shack it was a happy home
And we just couldn't help but fall in love
That big black dog and that little old shack
Sitting down by the railroad track
It's plenty good enough for me and Joshua
Joshua Joshua
Why you're just what I've been looking for
Joshua Joshua
You ain't gonna be lonesome anymore
No no
Yodel-a-he-ho
Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua yeah yeah
Me and Joshua"
"There must be something fishy goin' on
You said you were goin' on a fishing trip with some old friend
You said that you'd be home tonight somewhere around ten
Well here it is it's two o'clock and you're still not at home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
I think that I'm a sucker that's swallowing your line
I try to make myself believe that it's all in my mind
But you never ask me if I'd like to go along so there must be something fishy goin' on
There's something fishy goin' on on these fishing trips you're goin' on
I'm gettin' tired of staying home alone
Some night when you come home and discover that I'm gone
You can bet there's something fishy goin' on
I guess some large-mouth bass left that lipstick on your shirt
I don't think you're a fisherman honey I think you're a flirt
Well if you're goin' fishing then why don't you bring them home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
here's something fishy goin' on...
Yes you can bet there's something fishy goin' on"

Just like the tide goes with the sea
We belong together, you and me
Just like the dawn followed by day
We'll always be together
And that's just how it will stay
It must be you that's always walking in my dreams
It must be you who'll always be right next to me
So when you find yourself alone
Just think of me and I'll be there
Must be you by my side the whole way through
Just like the fresh white winter snow
Our love is pure and it will always grow
And when we're in those autumn years
Together, we'll look back, but we won't shed a single tear
It must be you that's always walking in my dreams
It must be you who'll always be right next to me
So when you find yourself alone
Just think of me and I'll be there
Must be you by my side the whole way through
When you find yourself alone
Just think of me and I'll be there
Must be you by my side the whole way through"
"It's you that
I run to
Whenever I need to
Darling, you console me
When trouble surrounds me
When bad times have found me
Just reach out your arms and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Darling please take me
In your arms of safety
Reach out your arms
And hold me
Hold me
When my feelings are showing
When my tears are flowing
Just reach out
Reach out and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
You know all of my needs
You fill them completely
You know
That you control me
I depend on
Your lovin'
Without you
I'm nothin'
So reach out
Your arms and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Darling please take me
In your arms of safety
Reach out you arms
And hold me
Hold me
When life is demanding
When I need understanding
Reach out
Reach out and hold me
Hold me
Hold me"
"Let's live for tonight dear it's better that way tomorrow we might be apart
Let's live for tonight dear let love let its way
For tomorrow we could have two broken hearts
Lets cast all our worries and heartaches inside forget what the future might hold
Let's live for tonight dear in a world all our own
For tomorrow we may have to be alone
Let's live for tonight dear and try to pretend that we will never be alone
No matter what happened this night will be ours
What tomorrow brings nobody ever knows
For tomorrow we may have to be alone"
"Tonight i feel a chill in the air
As cold as that look on your face
I hear what you're saying but coming from you
Goodbye seems so out of place
Now how can you stand there and honestly say
There never wee any real promises made
[Chorus]
The moon is my witness
The stars will agree
They all heard you promise
You'd always love me
I know that it's true
But it's hard to believe
You lied to the moon
The stars and me
And what about all of those warm tender nights
Did they mean nothing to you
And where are the feelings i thought that we shared
Or have you forgotten them too
Did you think i could just put your memory behind
When your words are still so very clear in my mind
[Chorus:Repeat x2]"
"(Dolly Parton)
A different lover ev'ry day
Same old book just a diff'rent page
Same old lines in the same old play
I've got to find somebody I can love all the way
I wanna fall in love, someone that I can live with
I wanna fall in love, someone to take and give with
I wanna fall in love, someone I can be real with
I wanna fall in love
I want someone to be just mine
Someone to be with all the time
A real true love is hard to find
And I don't know where I'll find him
But I've got to keep on tryin' cause
I wanna fall in love, if you hear me, listen to me
I wanna fall in love, I'm undone so come and do me
I wanna fall in love, if you got love, give it to me"
"You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
The day I met you my heart spoke to me
It said to love you through eternity
Now knowing that you were another's bride
I vowed I'll always be close by your side
You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
You broke a heart dear that would die for you
I'd give this world dear to belong to you
The game is over now and we've both lost
A broken heart will have to pay the cost
You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still"
"I've chased after rainbows
I've captured one or two
I've reached for the stars
I've even held a few
I've walked that lonesome valley
Topped the mountain, sowed the sky
I've laughed and I have cried
But I have always tried
I've always been a dreamer
And dreams are special things
But dreams are of no value
If they're not equipped with wings
So secure yourself for climbing
Make ready for the flight
Don't let your chance go by
You'll make it if you try
So try to be the first one up the mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to be the one who makes a difference
Try to put your fear and doubt aside
And try to make the most of every moment
'Cause if you never try you never win
So try each day to try a little harder
And if you fall, get up and try again
(Try and try and try)
(Try and try and try)
Nothing is impossible
If you can just believe
Don't live your life in shackles
When faith can be the key
The winner's one who keeps determination in his eyes
Who's not afraid to fly and not afraid to try
So try to be the first one up the mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to count your blessings and keep counting
And try to soar where only eagles fly
And if you fail at first just keep on trying
For you are not a failure in God's eyes
The first step is the one that's always hardest
But you won't amount too much if you don't try
So spread your wings and let the magic happen
Cause you'll never really know if you don't try
(Try and try and try)
You gotta try (Try and try and try)
Come give it a try (Try and try and try)
You have to try (Try)
Oh I know it ain't easy
Who ever said it was?
Life is hard
Same as it ever was (Try)
You have to try (You have to try)
When you think you can't do it, just try a little harder
Just dig a little deeper and go a little farther but try (Try)
You have to try (Try)
Whatever it is, you're gonna get through it
Let the spirit lead you, I know you can do it, just try (Try)
Just give it a try
And whenever you think you ain't gonna make it
Put a smile on your face, suck it up and fake it
For a while (Give it a try)
At least you'll know you tried (Give it a try)
Don't think I don't suffer, I know what I'm saying
When I get to that place when I start praying and I try
Lord knows I try
Yes I try"
"You're the one that puts the sparkle in my eyes
You're the one that puts the laughter in my smile
You're the one that puts the meaning in my life
And I'm bubbling over, bubbling over, bubbling over
Because you are mine
Bubbling over with the joy that only love can bring
Bubbling over with the song you taught my heart to sing
And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone can see
That I'm bubbling over, bubbling over, bubbling over
Because you love me
I have never known a love that felt like this
You're the one I want to share my lovin' with
Your gentle way of lovin' me and your thoughtfulness
Keeps me bubbling over, bubbling over, bubbling over
With happiness
Bubbling over with the joy that only love can bring
Bubbling over with the song you taught my heart to sing
And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone could see
That I'm bubbling over, bubbling over, bubbling over
Because you love me"

At last I have called up with you and you're a sight to see
Could this really be my outlaw lover JJ Sneed
Could a woman with a painted face and pretty sweet disguise
Turn your heart against me with her evil cunning eyes her evil cunning eyes
JJ it's been you and me right from the very start
And ever job we ever pulled I'd always done my part
We'd really stick together until the bitter end
And it was my understanding we were whole lots more than friends
A whole lot more than friends
And it was me that kept you on when nights were dark and cold
But I guess I didn't look like much in these old ragged clothes
But you said it didn't matter cause you love me that a way
You said that no one else could ever steal your heart away steal your heart away
Do you recall the Union Bank we robbed in Franklin Town
And as we made our getaway the sheriff gunned you down
And I doctored up your bullet wounds and nursed you while you sit
But now you have betrayed me is that the thanks I get is that the thanks I get
Oh yeah JJ I'm thinking now of how we'd all begun
Of all the times we've robbed and killed with our trust wordy gun
Why we stood off a fuss it was JJ just you and I
But now you have betrayed me and for that you're gonna die
Yeah for that you're gonna die
The good old days are over as we stand here in the rain
JJ I'm gonna shoot you now I hope you'll feel no pain
I hear whoopees of the horses and fieces on my trail
I guess I'll join you soon but for now JJ farewell for now JJ farewell"
"Today you told me that you'd found another
And you took off your golden wedding band
The one you vowed you'd wear until death do us part
When I kissed it and placed it on your hand
A read will hang upon your door tomorrow
Of the little house that we once called our home
And friends will stop and hang their heads in sorrow
To pay the last respects to one gone on
Tonight I lay me down to sleep forever with this small empty bottle and broken heart
I keep the vow I made I won't forsake it I promised to death do us part
Will you bring your new love to the chapel
To look upon the one that you betrayed
Will you bring me pretty flowers like you used to
And replace them in my hands where I lay
Will you cry and think of happy mem'ries that we shared together at the start
And will you look upon me and remember the dsay we said till death do us part"
"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
[Chorus]
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town"

Last night as I lay on the boxcar
Just waiting for a train to pass by
What will become of the hobo
Whenever his time comes to die
There's a Master up yonder in heaven
Got a place that we might call our home
Will we have to work for a living
Or can we continue to roam
Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride
Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there
Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride
Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there"
"Let's start by stopping long enough to talk things over
Since there's a new love burning between us
With open-minded understanding between us
Let's both feel free to talk of this new love
Let there be no deep dark secrets between us
Let's never hide behind a false disguise
Let there be no hidden feelings between us
An honest love is a love that will survive
In our love let's share a friendship between us
Always close enough to talk things out
Let's be honest with ourselves and with each other
And our love will never know mistrust or doubt
Let there be no deep dark secrets...
An honest love is a love that will survive"

I'm lookin' for a way to get out there's no hope for you and me
We'll never get along everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
We stopped loving a long time ago and now all we do is disagree
There's no use to pretend there's no need to try again
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
There's no use for us to live a lie
When we're just wasting the best years of our lives
We'll never get along everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me"

We'll sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
I will never love you
The cost of love's too dear
But though I'll never love you
I'll live with you one year
And we will sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
I'll sing to you each morning
I'll kiss you every night
But darlin', don't cling to me
I'll soon be out of sight
But we can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
My daddy he once told me
Hey, don't you love you any man
Just take what they can give you
And give but what you can
And you can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
And when our year has ended
And I have gone away
I'll often speak about you
And this is what I'll say
You know we sang in the sunshine
We laughed every day
We sang in the sunshine
Then I went on my way"

We'd work in the fields till the sun had gone down

When you love somebody with all your heart and soul
And you want to keep them with you, but you know they want to go
What do you do, what do you say
When you know they want to leave
As bad as you want them to stay
And there's nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love
When one doesn't care at all and the other cares too much
It's a sad situation, I must say
When you know they want to leave
As bad as you want them to stay
You know how much I love you
But I know you don't love me
And I know it's just a matter of time before you leave
But I do, I stand aside and just let you walk away
But I know you want to leave
As bad as I want you to stay"

And Oprah was talkin' on TV this mornin'
She said when love dies, there's no need to keep mourning
The honeymoon's over, there's no vital signs
Though he's the same age I am, he's grown old before my time
And I'm tired of livin' with a dead man
I don't believe that I can
Continue in the manner I've been going
I try to dress up sexy for him
My sexy clothes just bore him
He says he's got a headache
Now my disappointment's showing, ooo-ooo"

Oh the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
Never saying what they mean
Oh they whine away the hours
In their ivory towers
Til they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Oh they make one another cry
Break their hearts and they say good-bye
Cross their heart and they hope to die
That the other was to blame
Neither one will ever give in
So they gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' 'bout the way it might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Oh they teach how to meditate
Read your horoscope and teach you faith
The furthermore the hell with hate
Come on and get on board
Look around and tell me what you see
What's a-happenin' to you and to me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play"

A broken heart like a broken wing
It must have its time to mend
I am like a crippled bird
In hopes one day to fly again
I loved you so and I was faithful
I cared more than words could say
But love is cruel and life is hateful
Now you've gone and flown away
Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure
Slow to heal, but quick to cry
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly
Oh, the loss is cold and shameful
And the grief so deep and sharp
There is nothing quite as painful
As a true blue broken heart
Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure
Slow to heal, but quick to cry
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly"

Backstory:
Tabloid prediction: Dolly Parton will announce she's falling madly in love with a 300 pound professional wrestler. She'll write a song about their relationship titled ""Headlock on My Heart"" and feature her massive muscleman in the video.
Dolly: Now this actually came out in this magazine. Now, you folks I'm sure buy these every week at the supermarket, right? And you know they never put anything in these magazines that's not true, right? So I figured since I was gonna fall in love anyhow, why wait? So I went out and I found me a 300 pound wrestler and I sat down and I wrote a song called ""Headlock on My Heart"" and I did a video. As a matter of fact, in the same magazine on a page opposite, there was a picture of Hulk Hogan. Now, I love Hulk Hogan. My Daddy's crazy about him, so I called Hulk, I said ""Would you do this?"" 'Cause the song is a fantasy, and it's about a guy named Starlight Starbright. He said ""Aw sure, I'd do anything with you, Dolly!"" I said ""Well, thanks, Hulk, I ought to hug your neck!"" So wouldn't that be something if me and Hulk really wound up getting married? Watch this video...
Song:
The first time that I saw him
Was in a wrestling magazine.
Then I watched him on TV,
Then I bought a ringside seat.
His name was Starlight Starbright,
The greatest in the land.
He sprinkled stardust in my eyes
I was his biggest fan.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Referee: 300 pounds of magic right here in the ring tonight.
Starlight Starbright: Wrestling fans, big and small, who's the greatest of them all?
Dolly: Starlight! Starlight Starbright! Starlight! Starlight Starbright!
He dazzled 'em with brilliance,
He outshined all the rest.
And I loved the heart that beat
Beneath his massive golden chest.
Spoken:
Dolly: In this ring, I thee wed.
Referee: Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
Starlight Starbright: I do!
Referee: And do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
Dolly: I do, I truly do!
Referee: I now pronounce you man and wife.
Dolly: Uh, you may now kiss the bride.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Dolly: Well, it's a whole new arena for me,
But it's a whole new wrestling match for him.
I guess you could say he pinned me down for a lifetime.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart."
"I can see the sunshine again
And I can see the blue sky where there once was fog and rain
We know each other now clear through and through
The fog has lifted between me and you
I loved you the first time I saw you
For it seemed like I had known you all my life
Well I loved you too but it takes a long time
To know what hurts you what helps you and know how you feel deep inside
I'm so happy you found out before it was too late
Our beautiful love could have turned into hate
Forgiving and understanding gives us a clear view
The fog has lifted between me and you
Now there's the sunshine again..."
"Cry, cry darlin', that's what I'll do
If you should leave me with the blues
Cry, cry darlin', that's what I'll do
If you're the one that I should lose
For me there will be no moonlight
If ever we should part
Cry, cry darlin', that's all I'll do
'Cause you're the one that's in my heart
Cry, cry darlin', my eyes would cry
And never dry if you should go
Cry, cry darlin', when shadows creep
I'll just weep all night I know
You know how much I'd miss you
If ever we should part
Cry, cry darlin', that's all I'll do
'Cause you're the one that's in my heart"
"Last Saturday night I looked like a princess dressed in calico
Now blue Monday washday I look like a lady hobo
Just rubbin' and a scrubbin' and a raisin' 'em out
I gotta hang 'em out early I hope the sun comes out
(Wash 'em out ring 'em out hang 'em on the line
Get a little tired just think about the good times) washday blues
Now I ain't never been very lucky I ain't never won a prize
But I'd like to get a job on TV for some of that soap they advertise
Rubbin' and scrubbin...
Well that good lookin' good lovin' no good man of mine
Could buy me a washin' machine
But he spends all his money on payday to make me look like a queen
Now rubbin' and scrubbin'..."
"You got a snazzy new car in your driveway
And expensive new clothes on your back
Every short skirt on the highway
Has spent time in your bachelor pad
We dance and you look over my shoulder
And make eyes at somebody else
You swear that you're not, but you know that's a croc
Cause you only care for yourself
Your attitude stinks and I hate it
You're arrogant, cocky and rude
You're selfish, conceited and jaded
Everything's all about you
You think that I'm lucky to have you
You think you're so handsome, so what
I'm callin' you out cause I don't need this crap
I'm gettin' myself outta dodge
Cause you don't know love from shinola
With you love is not what I found
A woman needs someone to hold her
Not someone to just lay her down
I want someone I can count on
A cool headed, warm hearted shoulder
To cry on, rely on, today and from now on
But you don't know love from shinola
You don't know love
From shinola
Oh but I gave you love and affection
But you never gave one iota
It was an early detection
That you don't know love from shinola
You don't know love from shinola
You don't know what true loves about
Well you'll find your world growin' colder
When you're alone and without
So go on, lover boy, have a big time
Drink up on your bourbon and cola
When you sober up you'll be *beep* outta luck
Cause you don't know love from shinola
I'm in it for love, but you're just plain stuck
You don't know love from shinola"
"(Dolly Parton)
Last night you called me Barbara
As you lay fast asleep
And although I'm not Barbara
You wanted me to be
You whispered words I haven't heard
In such a long, long time
Last night you said I love you
With Barbara on your mind
Sometimes I find traces of her kisses on your skin
And strands of chestnut hair
That say you've been with her again
Little traces of her that it breaks my heart to find
Last night you called me darlin'
With Barbara on your mind
With Barbara on your mind
You held me in your arms so tight
And lying there so close to you
I cried until day light"
"There was a time we'd sit in the backyard cause the house would get so hot
From the summer sun there was no way of sleepin'
And you'd play your old guitar we'd fight mosquitoes and enjoyed
You backyard concerts for we had no television
We'd just begun our life as man and wife and hard ships then
Could scaresly scare us into quittin'
Things were far from bein' fine we often dined upon a dime
But there never was a time we didn't love
The Christmas brought us saddest days
When your pride gave a way you told the kids
There'd be no gifts cause we were broke
Though their little tears of grief was so hard to see it didn't hurt me
Like the love I knew was in your throat
It was then with arms entwined we both broke down and cried
For it seemed ike nothing good would ever come
The doctor bills we couldn't pay they came and took our car away
But there never was a time we didn't love
Now there's an easy chair for my back a satin pillow for your head
And the kids are wild about the brand new car
You and I can order steak with all the trimmings and not worry
If we've spent a dollar more than we can spare
No wonder in your prayers we've thanked the man upstairs who led us through
The years of rearin' kids and payin' bills
And I think he guide us not because we were smart but just because
There never was a time we didn't love
No there never was a time never was a time never was a time we didn't love"
"I couldn't believe it the day that you left
Cleaned out your closet, cleared off your shelves
Loaded your car and you drove out of sight
But I never said goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open, I leave on a light
I'm always waiting in case you drop by
I'll never say goodbye
People have told me you have a new love
My heart's not willing to give up on us
I've convinced myself they're just telling me lies
And I'll never say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open, I leave on a light
I never wanted you out of my life
And I'll never say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open, I leave on a light
I'll be loving you till the day that I die
And I'll never say goodbye
If you'll just come back, I won't even ask why
I'll never say goodbye, no, I'll never say goodbye"
"DADDY WAS AN OLD TIME PREACHER MAN
(Dolly Parton - Dorothy Jo Hope)
Daddy was an old time preacher man
He preached the word of God throughout the land
He praeached so plain a child could understand
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
He told the people of the need to pray
He talked about God's wrath on Judgement Day
He preached about that great eternity
He breathed hell so hot that you could feel the heat
Daddy was an old time preacher man and Leona would get up to testify
As we'd sing in the sweet by and by then we'd sing I'm on my way to Canaan's
Land
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
Revivals and camps meeting's with four weeks
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
But the aisles were all we stilled in altar call
Daddy was an old time preacher man...
Daddy worked for God but asked no pay for he believed that God provides away
We never had a lot but we got by
I guess it's cause the Lord was on my daddy's side
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
I'm on my way to Canaan's Land yes daddy was an old time preacher man
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
I'm on my way to Canaan's Land yes daddy was an old time preacher man"
"Oh, you drive me crazy.
I can't stop the way I feel.
Things you do don't seem real.
Tell you what I got in mind
'Cause we're runnin' out of time.
Just turn loose and let it be,
This waitin' 'round is killin' me.
You drive me crazy like no one else.
You drive me crazy and I can't help myself.
I can't get any rest. People say that I'm obsessed.
You're everything I want in life, but to me that's no surprise.
And what I have I'll give to you.
I hope you feel the same way, too.
'Cause you drive me crazy
Like no one else.
You drive me crazy and I can't help myself.
I won't make it on my own.
No one likes to be alone.
You drive me crazy, yes it's true.
I'd give it all up just to be with you.
'Cause you drive me crazy like no one else.
Oh, you drive me crazy and I can't help myself, I can't help myself.
Oh, you drive me crazy like no one else.
You drive me crazy and I can't help myself.
Oh, you drive me crazy like no one else.
Oh, you drive me crazy and I can't help myself.
Oh, you drive me crazy like nobody else.
You drive me crazy, can't help myself.
I'm gonna hold you all night long.
And I'm gonna love you 'til the cows come home.
Drive me crazy like a rock in my shoe.
I can't keep my mind off-a you.
Drive me crazy and that's a fact,
You're the one that's a makin' me feel like that.
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy, I'm a lunatic.
I'd do anything for your sweet kiss.
Drive me crazy, can't help myself.
Drive me crazy like nobody else.
You drive me crazy, oh you drive me crazy."
"(Dolly Parton)
There will come a day when sorrow fades away,
And anguish and heartache shall ease,
No mothers cryin', no soldiers dyin',
And turmoil and misery shall cease.
The hungry shall be fed, the aimless shall be led
And sad eyes will no longer weep,
The last shall be first, through heaven he'll burst
With his heavenly host from the East
Weapons to plowshares, hate turns to love,
Descending from heaven he'll sweep down to us
In radiant splendor; oh, won't it be sweet
When the raven of darkness turns into a white dove of peace
(Raven dove)
Oh, there will come a day when I'll fly away
Forever to be in his keep
Eternal life in the sweet by and by
When raven dove, raven dove speaks
When lambs walk with lions, a child tames the beast
Nations shall gather and bow at his feet
And loved ones shall rise up from their earthly sleep
And he'll separate all the chaff from the wheat.
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, how sweet
When the raven of darkness turns into a white dove of peace
Raven dove, behold he cometh in the clouds
And every eye shall see him
Sweet bird, sweet bird of peace
Raven Dove"
"As blue skies and daylight darken into night
Surrounding us with beauty as the stars make their light
They spell out our names all the stars up above
As they flicker and shine like letters of love
Then a warm breath of air whispers through the trees
As the leaves on their branches have blown to the breeze
Ripples of water seemed to echo the sound
Love's out tonight there's love all around
Small drops of dew act as nature's perfume
Placing its fragrance on all that's in blue
While I hold you so close your lips touching mine
With nature all around us watching our love entwine
Love's out tonight see the candles in the sky
God lend us the heavens tonight for you and I
A night full of love for all the world to see
Love's out tonight all around you and me
Love's out tonight"
"Tonight i feel a chill in the air
As cold as that look on your face
I hear what you're saying but coming from you
Goodbye seems so out of place
Now how can you stand there and honestly say
There never wee any real promises made
[Chorus]
The moon is my witness
The stars will agree
They all heard you promise
You'd always love me
I know that it's true
But it's hard to believe
You lied to the moon
The stars and me
And what about all of those warm tender nights
Did they mean nothing to you
And where are the feelings i thought that we shared
Or have you forgotten them too
Did you think i could just put your memory behind
When your words are still so very clear in my mind
[Chorus:Repeat x2]"
"Who do you think you are
What do you think this is
A game you can play
Tryin' to steal him away
Well, I don't need a heartache like this
Well, don't think I don't go through hell
But heaven is what we both want
He's easy to love, but he's hard to give up
And if you think I will, well, you're wrong
The best woman wins
I will fight 'til the end
I'll lay down and die if I must
I'll beg and I'll plead
I will suffer and bleed
But he must make a choice between us
This soap opera play that we're in
Is just like you watch on t.v.
But I never thought that I'd ever get caught in it;
Starring you, him and me
In love as in war all is fair
So a fight to the finish begins
When you fight from desire
You fight fire with fire
So may the best woman win
The best woman wins
I will fight 'til the end
I'll lay down and die if I must
I'll beg and I'll plead
I will suffer and bleed
But he must make a choice between us
So may the best woman win"
"(Dolly Parton)
From a shack by a mountain stream
To a room in New Orleans
So far from my Blue Ridge Mountain home
The men I meet ain't warm and friendly
Like the one in old Virginie
Oh they ain't real like my Blue Ridge Mountain boy
I was just a little past eighteen
When I came to New Orleans
I'd never been beyond my home state line
There was a boy who loved me dearly
But I broke his heart severely
When I left my Blue Ridge Mountain boy
Life was dull in my hometown
Lights were out when the sun went down
And I thought that city life was more my style
But nights get lonely away from home
And it's easy to go wrong
The men ain't kind like my Blue Ridge Mountain boy
New Orleans held things in store
Things I'd never bargained for
And every night a different man knocks on my door
But late at night when all is still
I can hear a whippoorwill
As I cry for my Blue Ridge Mountain boy
Oh but I can never go back home
Since the boy I love is gone
He grew tired of waiting for me to return
They say he married last October
But I never will get over
Oh the sweet love of my Blue Ridge Mountain boy
Blue Ridge Mountain boy"
"(Dolly Parton)
Come back to me
Come back and say you're still in love with me
Come back and say that I am all you'll ever need
Baby come back come back to me
Oh please come back to me
Come back and say you'll work it out with me
Come back to stay and say you're never gonna leave
Baby come back, come back to me
Oh and kiss me once again as only you can
Touch me like nobody else can do
Oh, oh, and hold me and show me you're still my man
And that you didn't need somebody new
Oh come back to me
Come back and hold this torch that's burning me
Come back and promise me eternity
Baby come back, won't you come back to me?
Kiss me once again as only you can
Touch me like nobody else can do
Oh, oh, oh, and hold me and show me you're still my man
And that you didn't need somebody new
Oh, come back to me
Come back and mend this broken heart in me
Without your love I know I'll never be complete
Baby come back, won't you come back to me
Oh please come back to me
Baby come back, baby come back to me
Baby come back, come back and say I'm all you need
Come back, won't you come back to me
Come back to me
Come back and say you're still in love with me
Come back and say that I am all you'll ever need
Baby come back won't you come back to me
Oh, please come back to me
Come back and hold this torch that's burning me
Come back and promise me eternity..."
"When troubles surround us, when evils come
The body grows weak
The spirit grows numb
When these things beset us, God doesn't forget us
He sends us His love
On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove
When Jesus went down through the river that day
Well, he was baptized in the usual way
And when it was done
God blessed His son
He sent him His love
On the wings of a dove
On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove"
"I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While traveling through this world of woe
Yet there's no sickness, toil or danger
In that bright world yo which I go
I'm going there to see my father
I'm going there no more to ram
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home
I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me
Where God's redeemed their vigils keep
I'm going there to my mother
She said she'd meet me when I come
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over me"
"You kindle the fire of love inside me
Each time our lips meet
I'm not strong when we're alone
Your kisses make me weak
You must know how I feel
But do you feel the same
Everytime you kiss me
You add fuel to the flame
My eyes light up when I see you
I burn with desire
Each time you're near
You say you'll care
But still I'm not sure
But please don't ask me to love you
If you're not gonna change my name
Everytime you touch me
You add fuel to the flame
This fire you started inside me
Has reached my very soul
You're adding fuel to a flame
That's already burning out of control
When you give me your name
I give you everything
Everytime you kiss me
Adds fuel to the flame
Yes everytime you touch me
You add fuel to the flame"
"(Dolly Parton)
Spotlight's on, it's shining bright
And I like standin' in it
It's only superficial light
But I don't want to end it
It's warmth and glow has taken hold
And I'm caught uup in it's shine
A Cinderella fairy tale
I want to claim as mine
Fancy clothes, a magic coach
And happy ever after
Like something from a story book
The Cinderella chapter
But when the clock strikes midnight
And I lie awake in bed
Things my Daddy told me
Keep running through my head
You gotta walk the straight and narrow
And to thine own self be true
Gotta aim straight as an arrow
All eyes are up on you
But sometimes it feels so good
That I can almost justify
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Is it wrong for me to want
The sweeter grass that's greener?
To chase the all-American dream
I've always been a dreamer
At the top and still I've got
A heavy heart inside
I keep remembering
Things my Daddy told me as a child
You gotta walk the striaght and narrow
Gotta hold fast to the right
Gotta aim straight as an arrow
Walk onward toward the light
Oh, but when I'm out there in it
I think I might get by
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
But I don't feel right livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
All the fame and fortune
Glory and prestige
Can't make me happy if it goes
Against what I believe
And I've sacrificed my honor
My values and my pride
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, I don't feel right"
"My heart beats - wild and deep
Every thought in my mind has your name on it
Hard to breathe - I can't speak
Think of your love and just how much I want it
Chorus:
When I'm touching you - I feel a sudden change
When I'm kissing you - I taste the sun and rain
When I look at you - I hear the angels sing
And when I'm holding you... I'm holding everything
Everything that's mine to give
Everything I can do - I'll do to prove it
For as long (for as long)
As I may live (as I may live)
My love will be there for you to use it
Chorus
Everything - I'm holding everything
When I'm touching you - I'm touching everything
When I'm kissing you - I'm kissing everything
Everything (everything) uh huh
My heart beats - wild and deep
Every thought in my mind has your name on it
It's hard to breathe (it's hard to breathe)
And I can't speak (I can't speak)
Think of your love and just how bad I - want it
And when you're touching me - I feel a sudden change
When you're kissing me - I taste the sun and rain
And when I look at you - I hear the angels sing
You're everything (everything)
I'm holding everything (everything)
Everything (you're everything)
You're everything (everything to me)
Everything (everything)
You're everything"

Eve you wicked woman, you done put your curse on me
Why didn't you just leave that apple hangin' in the tree
You make us hate our husbands, our lovers and our boss
Why I can't even count the good friends I've already lost
Cause of PMS blues, PMS blues
I don't even like myself, but it's something I can't help
I got those God almighty, slap somebody PMS blues
Most times I'm easy going, some say I'm good as gold
But when I'm PMS I tell ya, I turn mean and cold
Those not afflicted with it are affected just the same
You poor old men didn't have to grin and say ""I feel your pain""
PMS blues, PMS blues
You know you must forgive us for we care not what we do
I got those can't stop crying, dishes flying PMS blues
But you know we can't help it
We don't even know the cause
But as soon as this part's over, then comes the menopause
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord
We're going to always be a heap of fun
Like the devil taking over my body, suffering, suffering, suffering
Everybody's suffering, huh?
But a woman had to write this song, a man would be scared to
Lest he be called a chauvenist or just fall victim to
Those PMS blues
You know we'd kill for less than that
PMS blues
You don't want to cross my path
Cause a pitbull ain't no match
For these teeth a clenchin', fluid retention
Head a swellin', can't stop yellin'
Got no patience, I'm so hateful
PMS blues, premenstrual syndrome
Got those moods a swingin', tears a slingin'
Nothin' fits me when it hits me
Rantin', ravin', misbehavin'
PMS blues"
"(E. Kaz)
Of all the roads I've traveled and all the sights I've seen
The most amazing thing is the power of our dreams
And anything is possible for those who can believe
Just get your heart to rearrange its priorities
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
It takes faith in one another to see things eye to eye
And it's hard to trust but you know it's worth the try
There's a candle in my window and whenever you feel blue
You can bet your bottom dollar I'll be there for you
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little bit harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
Oh I do believe in miracles
But I know they don't come easy
So why don't we give destiny
A helping hand
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little bit harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
Life is just too beautiful
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work"
"(Dolly Parton)
The snow was fallin' swiftly and it mounted on the street
Little footprints in the snow made by our children's feet
As I walked them to the good will store to get some clothes to wear
As we turned around the corner I saw you standing there
I tried to turn the children and walk the other way
I prayed they hadn't seen you then I heard the baby say
""Mommie, ain't that Daddy holding out his hand
Begging for money from that other man?""
They asked me ""Ain't that Daddy?""
And ""Yes"" I had to say
And I wondered if I'd failed you
And made you turn this way
No, you didn't fail me, my weakness was just too strong
Because you see, I thought more of the bottle than our family and our home
No, you didn't fail me sweetheart, you loved me all you could
You had my babies and you loved me like no other woman ever would
You know I guess I'd be better off dead
Than in the awful shape I'm in
But death just don't seem to have a place for those that stay drunk on whiskey, wine and gin
You see I die a constant death over and over every day
If I could change, you know I'd do it for you, the babies and our home
But you might as well forget me for I'm just too forward gone
But I wish you would do me one last favor and do it just for me
When they ask you, ""Momma ain't that Daddy?""
Just say ""It used to be"""
"I love you so much I can't let you go
And sometimes I believe you love me
But somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a door without any key
Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a window that I can't see through
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky
Somewhere between me and you
[ steel ]
Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a love I can't understand
It's there for a while then it fades like a smile
And I'm left in the middle again
Somewhere between your heart and mine..."
"What a friend we have in Jesus all our sins and grieves to bear
And what a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer
Can we find a friend so faithful who will all our burden share
We should never be discouraged take it to the Lord in prayer
What a friend we have in Jesus...
What a friend we have in Jesus"
"As I travel life's pathway to that city beyond
I find the way so narrow and my strenght almost gone
Then I cry oh Lord have mercy please don't leave me all alone
Cause somehow I've got to make it make heaven my home
I'll keep climbing I'll keep climbing till I make it my home
And I'll soon be with Jesus round the great white throne
Though the way may seem rugged Lord I must travel on
I'll keep climbing I'll keep climbing till I make heaven my home
My friends they forsake me my companions are few
I'll keep my eyes toward heaven no matter what others do
I'll keep my mind upon Jesus for his way I will choose
Soon I'll reach heaven's portal seems it's almost in view
I'll keep climbing...
I'll keep climbing...
Make heaven my home"
"The cold December wind seems bent on rockin' New York City
The town that's got me down to my last dime
And everywhere I go, the people seem in such a hurry
To keep this Mobile girl from feelin' fine
[Chorus]
Lord, what I'd give to see an Alabama sundown
The sun just seemed to drop in Mobile Bay
New York town has got a gifted way to keep a girl down
But that never was the Mobile way, no, no
That never was the Mobile way
A flashing sign says that you can rent a bed for just a dollar
In anybody's town, that price is cheap
It's a shame to know a girl would ever fall down to my standards
Cause I need ninety cents to go to sleep
[Chorus]
I felt so big the day I left that Mobile couldn't hold me
I thought there had to be a better way
But if I could find that man that first called Lady Luck a lady
That gentleman would surely learn to pray
[Chorus: x2]"
"I found your letter in my mailbox today
You were just checkin' if I was okay
And if I still miss you
Well you know what they say
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
And I feel one comin' on soon
No need to tell me you'd like to be friends
And help me get back on my feet again
And do I still miss you?
Well it's just now and then
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
And I feel one comin' on soon
There's a blue moon shinin'
When I'm reminded
Of all we've been through
Such a blue moon shinin'
Does it ever shine down on you?
Oh, 'cause you act like
It never even hurt you at all
And I'm the only one
Gettin' up from a fall
Tell me you don't feel it
Oh can't you recall
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
Just once in a very blue moon
And I feel one comin' on soon"
"Oh, say can you see,
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,
Through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched,
Were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare,
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?"
"(Dolly Parton)
Come back to me
Come back and say you're still in love with me
Come back and say that I am all you'll ever need
Baby come back come back to me
Oh please come back to me
Come back and say you'll work it out with me
Come back to stay and say you're never gonna leave
Baby come back, come back to me
Oh and kiss me once again as only you can
Touch me like nobody else can do
Oh, oh, and hold me and show me you're still my man
And that you didn't need somebody new
Oh come back to me
Come back and hold this torch that's burning me
Come back and promise me eternity
Baby come back, won't you come back to me?
Kiss me once again as only you can
Touch me like nobody else can do
Oh, oh, oh, and hold me and show me you're still my man
And that you didn't need somebody new
Oh, come back to me
Come back and mend this broken heart in me
Without your love I know I'll never be complete
Baby come back, won't you come back to me
Oh please come back to me
Baby come back, baby come back to me
Baby come back, come back and say I'm all you need
Come back, won't you come back to me
Come back to me
Come back and say you're still in love with me
Come back and say that I am all you'll ever need
Baby come back won't you come back to me
Oh, please come back to me
Come back and hold this torch that's burning me
Come back and promise me eternity..."
"We'd get up before sun-up to get the work done up
We'd work in the fields till the sun had gone down
We've stood and we've cried as we have bristly watched
A hailstorm a' beatin' our crops to the ground
We've gone to bed hungry many nights in the past
In the good old days when times were bad
No amount of money could buy from me
The memories that I have of then
No amount of money could pay me
To go back and live through it again
I've seen daddy's hands break open and bleed
And I've seen him work till he's stiff as a board
An' I've seen momma layin' in suffer and sickness
In need of a doctor we couldn't afford
Anything at all was more than we had
In the good old days when times were bad
We've got up before and found ice on the floor
Where the wind would blow snow through the cracks in the wall
And I couldn't enjoy then, havin' a boyfriend
I had nothing decent to wear at all
So I long for a love that I never had
In the good old days when times were bad
No amount of money could buy from me
The memories that I have of then
No amount of money could pay me
To go back and live through it again
In the good old days when times were bad
In the good old days when times were bad"
"Life has dealt us our fair share of pain along the way
And many dreams have withered on the vine
But dreams are all such fleeting things and happiness is now
We'll just live our lives one day at a time
In all the stormy weather love has always seen us through
Happiness is knowing that you're mine
Why worry about tomorrow for tomorrow may not come
We'll just live our lives one day at a time
This one thing I'm learning you take life as it comes
Each day is just a gift so don't be blind
Tomorrow may bring gladness or a little bit of sadness
We'll just live our lives one day at a time
[ guitar ]
We may not have a fortune making plans to change the world
We may leave little marks in life's design
But as long as we're together every hour is filled with love
And we'll just live our lives one day at a time
Just one thing I'm learning...
We'll just live our lives one day at a time"
"That year the spring was six months long and love
Could do no wrong for love to open up the answers
The sun was stapled to the sky a junior prom July
And we at center stage where the dancers.
I knew you when the air was cold I'm there again
My dress was blue and it lay across the chair
Cause I love you I knew you well your heart
Could melt like caramel your eyes was deep like
The sun muddy stream where that tadpole stream
Child begin child you sleep
That year the fog would climb the beach and wrapped
Us out in preach from search lights that the sky
Would sending
I knew you first, I knew you best, I knew from the rest,
I knew you when the spring was ending
As time takes hold you maybe we're growing old
But in my pray I will you see to remain the time
Is sure of now and then it's only me"
"I can't forget you
Ever since the moment that I met you
You've been on my mind
And I need to somehow let you know
That I think about you all the time
[Chorus:]
So when you think about love, think about me
I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me
We were strangers
Now I'm already wrapped around your finger
Oh what's a heart to do
'Cause it lingers
And the thought of you
Wantin' me as much as I want you
[Chorus]
Makes me blue
I'm not holding you tonight
'Cause only you can satisfy
This heart of mine
[Chorus]"
"We don't take away one happy moment
We won't take away any of the new
We'll do anything to make each other happy
Love is give and take but we don't take away
I never thought that love could make you feel so happy
I thought I'd found love once but I wasn't even close not even close
Well you make me want to call you sweet names at the waking of each day
For each day I love you more and we won't ever take away
We don't take away one happy moment...
Love is give and take but we don't take away take away"
"Life's like poetry and in my poem bay
Until now there's always been a missing line
You know life's too short to hide a good thing you feel
And I find the morning after
Is the best time to determine if it's real
Baby, finding you gave my whole world reason to rhyme
'Cause life's like poetry and in my poem bay
Until now there's always been a missing line
Life's too short to think about right or wrong
And the only thing I wonder 'bout
Is where you been so long
'Cause baby finding you gave my whole world reason and rhyme
And life's like poetry and in my poem bay
Until now there's always been a missing line
Until now, there's always been a missing line"
"Well, I wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Cause there ain't no smog, no smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bill
Now but once I had me a man on Rocky Top
Half bear the other half cat
Well, he was wild as a mink but he was sweet as soda-pop
I often think about that
Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Now once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
Lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
And some say they never will
Did you know corn don't grow at all on Rocky Top?
The dirt's too rocky by far
And that's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar
Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Now I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped luck a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a dad-burn pity
Life can't be simple again
Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Rocky Top, Tennessee
Tennessee, Rocky Top"
"You never close your eyes anymore
When I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness
Like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it, baby
But baby, baby
I know it
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa...
Now there's no welcome look
In your eyes when I reach for you
And now you're starting to
Criticize little things I do
It makes me just feel like crying, baby
'Cause baby,
Something beautiful is dying
You lost that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa
Baby, baby,
I get down on my knees
And pray to you
If you would only love me
Like you used to do
We had a love, a love,
A love you don't find everyday
So don't, don't, don't
Don't let it slip away
Bring back that lovin' feeling
Oh, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on, whoa...
You've lost the lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost the lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Bring back that lovin' feeling,
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone"

I remember, I remember
I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember meadows and fields of golden wheat
I remember song birds and sugar cane so sweet
I remember lots of things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember ginger bread my momma used to bake
I remember home-made toys that Daddy used to make
Yes, I remember many things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember momma and daddy most of all
In our little country home they filled with love
I remember momma and daddy most of all
And all the things they did to make life happier for us
Yes I remember lots of things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember candy that daddy used to bring
I remember songs my momma used to sing
Oh I Remember many things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember momma and daddy most of all
And how they taught us children right from wrong
I remember momma and daddy most of all
How they used to hope and pray they'd live to see us grown
Oh I remember many things that often I recall
I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember, I remember
I remember momma and daddy most of all
Most of all"
"Love it's not I who didn't try
Hard enough, hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough
Love you don't see
The pain in me
That's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cried for us, I cried for us
I'll take my share but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff
Easy enough
And if you choose I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough
I've tried and tried to put aside
The time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked"
"There is a house down in New Orleans
Down in the Vieux Carr'e
A house they call the rising sun
Where love and money are made
My father he was a gambler
Mother died when I was young
And I've worked since then
To please the men
At the house of the rising sun
There is a house
Down in New Orleans
They call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh God, you know I'm one
So mothers you go telling all your daughters
Not to do what I've done
To live a life of sin, shame and strife
In the house of the rising sun"
"Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you
But I hope it ain't for long
And I wonder if you're even gonna notice that I'm gone
Oh it hurts to know you cheated
And it hurt to know you lied
But it hurts me even worse to know you never even tried
I packed my suitcase full of heartaches
Headin' for the train depot
And I bought a one-way ticket
On that train they call Blue Smoke
I left the station straight-up midnight
Feelin' lonely, lost and blue
In a trail of blue smoke with my heart broke
Said good-bye to you
Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Oh, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through"
"(Dolly Parton)
He lived by the apple orchard in this little orchard shack
His real name was Jackson Taylor but I called him AppleJack
Now old AppleJack was loved by everyone he ever knew
AppleJack picked apples but he picked the banjo too
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring
Now I'd go down to AppleJack's almost everyday
We'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old AppleJack had made
Then he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if I'd sing
And he would play the banjo and I'd play my tambourine
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring
That's when I was just a kid and now that I am grown
All I have are memories, old AppleJack is gone
Oh but he left me his banjo and it always takes me back
And everytime I play it I still hear AppleJack
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring"

The mid summer sun shines but dim the fields try in vain to look gay
But when I was happy with him December was pleasant as May
There once was a time he and I picked flowers to braid in my hair
And the songbirds would sing sweet song of love that was tender and fair
No difference the seasons may quit our love was as warm as the sun
And it mattered not where did the snow
Or green grass kissed the fields where we'd run
Now the mid summer sun shines...
Sweet flowers sweet birds and sweet song have now lost their sweetness to me
For ever my darling is gone and for ever my heartbroken I'll be
Now the mid summer sun shines...
The mid summer sun shines but dim mmm"
"(Dolly Parton)
I was lookin' for greener pastures
When I left my old Kentucky home
I was chasin' after dreams I thought I'd master
So I left the one that loved me all along
Thinkin' only of myself and doin' better
Didn't care about the grief I left behind
Didn't even make a card or write a letter
So sure I'd be successful in no time
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures
And back to the one who's heart I broke
To the bluegrass state of Kentucky
Where he waits with open for me I hope
Ain't it funny how you are when you're younger?
How what you have is never good enough
How the years will find you searchin' through your plunder
Lookin' for the treasures you gave up
Well the seasons came, they went
The dreams all shattered
While the grass just stayed a lonely shade of brown
Then I realized I'd lost all that had mattered
So with foolish pride aside, I'm homeward bound
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures
And back to the one who's heart I broke
To the bluegrass state of ole Kentucky
Where he waits with open for me I hope
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures
Where the bluegrass waves sweetly in the wind
Where the bluegrass music's always playin'
To the haunting sound of Monroe's mandolin
I'm heading for bluer pastures"
"Let's live for tonight dear it's better that way tomorrow we might be apart
Let's live for tonight dear let love let its way
For tomorrow we could have two broken hearts
Lets cast all our worries and heartaches inside forget what the future might hold
Let's live for tonight dear in a world all our own
For tomorrow we may have to be alone
Let's live for tonight dear and try to pretend that we will never be alone
No matter what happened this night will be ours
What tomorrow brings nobody ever knows
For tomorrow we may have to be alone"
"(Dolly Parton)
The bright lights of the city are a pretty site to see
Perhaps they're extra pretty to a country girl like me
Temptation waits at every turn and it won't let me be
So mama when you pray tonight
Say a special prayer for me
I miss your tender good-night kiss of love and understanding
The good-night kisses I get now are cruel and so demanding
So mama when you pray tonight
And while you're on your knees
Mama say a special prayer for me
The nights get cold and lonely
When you're faraway from home
And lonely makes it easy for a good girl to go wrong
Evil eyes search through the night for lonely girls like me
So mama when you pray tonight
Say a special prayer for me
I miss your tender good-night kiss of love and understanding
These good-night kisses I get now are cruel and so demanding
So mama when you pray tonight
And while you're on your knees
Mama say a special prayer for me"
"Soft as the voice of an angel, breathing a lesson unheard
Hope with a gentle persuasion whispers her comforting word
Wait till the darkness is over, wait till the tempest is gone
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow, after the shower is gone
Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice
Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice"
"(Dolly Parton)
I grew up dirty and I grew up poor
The wolf didn't even hang 'round our door
Not a crumb to spare and the cupboard bare
And I had the gift of imagination
I could change my situation
Anytime I choose I could always go
Down Paradise Road
I found a kingdom deep within
A place dream and to pretend
And to prepare for the world out there
A dream can dress you when you're ragged
Fill you up when hunger's naggin'
I warmed my soul when life was cold
On Paradise Road
Chorus:
Paradise is a state of mind
The sun shines warm and all the time
And the rain don't flow and the wind don't blow
On Paradise Road
A place no one can take from me
A place of everlasting peace
Where dreamers go; It's never closed
Paradise Road
Paradise is a state of mind
Down the road of life and time
And the friends we meet
Make the travlin' sweet
On Paradise Road
Sometimes now when the world is mad
I find that place I've always had
Inside my soul; It's paved in gold
Paradise Road
I grew up dirty and I grew up poor
The wolf didn't even hang 'round our door
Not a crumb to spare and the cupboard bare
But I had the gift of imagination
I could change my situation
Anytime I choose I could always go
Down Paradise Road"
"I have to mow the lawn
And I have to wash the car
And I'd just like to know
Just who you think you are
I'm gettin' tired of wagging
That old heavy garbage can
Your woman's gettin' tired
Of being your ole handy man
I have to run your water
And I have to wash your back
And I have to scrub the tub
After you have had your bath
You're as helpless as a baby
But I love you, understand
I'm just gettin' tired
Of being your ole handy man
Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man
Now I know you've got ten fingers
But where's your helpin' hand
I've just made a decision
I've stood all I'm gonna stand
Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man
I do everything for you
You never help yourself
An' I think I'd die from shock
If you raised a hand to help
Well, I'm not gonna keep it up
That's what you got planned
Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man
Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man
Now I know you got ten fingers
But where's that helpin' hand
I've just made a decision
I've stood all I'm gonna stand
Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man
Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man"
"Someone else's arms will hold you my darling baby girl
I'll never get to see the child I've brought into this world
Because I made one mistake folks say that I'm bad
But they just don't understand the way I loved your dad
Now I thought your daddy loved me I was so sure he did
And so I gave him all my love and he said we would wed
But I guess he must changed his mind cause she left town one day
When he found out about you he just stopped and ran away
In this home so far away from home I leave my heart today
Cause home where the heart is and with you my heart will stay
Because I love you so much why I can't make you pay
So I'm doing this for your sake I'm giving you away"
"You ought to go north somebody told us
'Cause the air is filled with gold dust
And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands
Now I don't recall who said it
But we'd spent our lives on credit
And so we headed out to find our promised land
Just poor Smokey Mountains farm folk
With nothing more than high hopes
So we hitched our station wagon to a star
But our dreams all fell in on us
'Cause there was no land of promise
Lord it's a struggle just keepin' sight of who you are
Oh, and these northern nights are dreary
My old southern heart is weary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I know that they all love me
And I know they're thinking of me
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong
You know I've been thinkin' just a whole lot lately
About what's been and what awaits me
It takes all I've got to give what life demands
Lord, you go insane if you give in to it
Life's a mill and I've been through it
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands
Oh, and these northern nights they're dreary
These old southern eyes are teary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus
I know He'll love and guide and lead us
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong
If I'll keep looking to the Father
He'll keep my heads above the water
While the Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong
My home sweet home"
"If you need me I'll be gone
The bed's still warm where you just left but it'll be colder where I've slept
I've always been where you needed me but I ain't the fool I used to be
You come home all hours of the night the fragrance on you ain't old spice
Tonight when you come draggin' home and find you need me I'll be gone
I'll be gone like the moon when the sun comes up
Gone like the dew from the buttercup
Gone like a woman treated wrong
If you need me I'll be gone
So what am I still doing here you've been doing me wrong for years
Tired of pickin' up and puttin' out I'm a leaving you lock stock and house
So bye bye baby that's it I'm packed I'm a leaving now but I'll call back
And leave this message on the code a phone sayin'
If you need me, well, I'll be gone
I'll be gone like the moon when the sun comes up
Gone like the moon when the sun comes up
I said if you need me, well, I'll be gone
If you need me I'll be gone
I said if you need me, well, I'll be gone, gone
If you need me I'll be gone gone
If you need me I'll be gone"
"Hold my hand let's not lose my way hold my hand and lead me home
Guide each step that I might take hold my hand and keep me strong
And let the path I walk be straight let the deeds I do be kind
Let me never hesitate to help my brother walking blind
Hold my hand...
And let my words have meaning of anything that I might speak
If you see me leaning on just hold my hand and straighten me
Hold my hand...
Amen"
"You and I have been together for a long long time
And we vowed that we would stay together always
Life at times has been unpleasant down the trails where fate had led us
But we pray that God will let us be together always
Together together together always you and me
Forever and ever together always you and me
[ piano ]
Throught the years our love will multiply and be divided
By the children added to enrich our lives
God's been good to you and I and in heaven there's eternal life
Beyond this world where you and I will be together always
Together together...
Together together..."
"So often in my dreams
I hold you close against my skin
Waking up I wish that I could
Sleep and dream again
Cause only when I sleep
Can I not hear how it's a sin
How cheaters never win
Their heartaches never end
""Torn Between Two Lovers"" on the jukebox
And I'm thinking how I could've wrote that song
Wonderin' if God loves us, when we're cheatin'
But why he lets us feels things if it's wrong
I guess I should be singing ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"", some of those good songs
Can't find it in my heart to ask forgiveness
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
Thou shalt not commit it
It's written in the tin
The spirit is always willing
But the flesh is weak again
And you're as close to heaven
As I might ever fly
An angel in disguise
A wrong that feels so right
And Torn Between Two Lovers just keeps playing
And I don't wanna be right if lovin' you is wrong
It goes against all I've ever stood for
Knowin' I have someone else at home
I guess I should be singing ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"", some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart can tell on me tomorrow
Cause anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
To hell with heaven if it means I'll lose you
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
It just can't be"
"Well, I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
Saying something about a queen
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at mother nature on the run
In the twentieth century
Look at mother nature on the run
In the twentieth century
I was lying in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eye
I was hoping for replacement
When the sun burst through the sky
There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like I could cry
I was thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There was children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream, the loading had begun
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home"

Yes I see God where the mountains reach the sky
And I see God when the eagle starts to fly
I see God in a little baby's smile I see God and he makes my life worthwhile
Yes I see God when the bridegroom meets his bride
I see God in a father's loving eyes
I see God when a mother starts to cry I see God in a love that never dies
(I see God) where the people meet to pray (I see God) in the things they do and
say
(I see God) when the little children play
I see God and I know he's near all way
I see God yes I see God"
"(Dolly Parton)
I know you think you love her and you're making plans to leave
But I must tell you something I just hope you'll believe
I know it isn't real love that you see in her eyes
Cause she's never met a man she didn't like
And you're no different from the others
A new acquaintence in the night
You mean no more to her than all the others she's held tight
But I know she's convinced you it was love at first sight
But she's never met a man she didn't like
I must let you go but I want you to know
That I love you please don't let her ruin our lives
For there'll be other men and she won't want you then
She's never met a man she didn't like
I must let you go but I want you to know
That I love you please don't let her ruin our lives
For she'll have other men oh and she won't want you then
Cause she's never met a man she didn't like
Oh no she's never met a man she didn't like"
"Back through the years I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
""Perhaps this coat will brang you good luck and happiness""
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colors that my momma made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my momma made for me
So with patches on my britches, holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
and my coat of many colors my momma made for me
And oh I couldn't understand that for I thought I was rich
And then I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed
And why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes
They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
One is only poor only if you choose to be
It is true we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors momma made for me
Made just for me"
"(Porter Wagoner)
Chorus:
Oh, on a highway headed south somewhere to Dixie
Where the cotton blooms in the spring and the snow don't fly
I'm gonna rest these chillin' bones in the Southern sunshine
And live where the weather's warm until I die
North Dakota, you got my better years
Montana, you got five years of my life
But the earth's sub-zero wind will never touch me again
A Southern girl can't live on snow and ice
Repeat Chorus
When I cross the Dixie line, I'll throw away my coat
And my goose-down underwear will have to go
I'll never live again where the weather chills you to the bone
I'm tired of livin' like an Eskimo
Repeat Chorus
On a highway headed south somewhere to Dixie
Where the cotton blooms in the spring and the snow don't fly
I'm gonna rest these willin' bones in the Southern sunshine
And live where the weather's warm until I die
Repeat Chorus & Fade"
"(Dolly Parton)
Preacher Tom, your friends are many
And your good deeds are a plenty
And I know that God is plenty proud of you
Cause you've directed your attention
Towards a bright and shining mansion
God promise to the ones that pay their dues
So preacher Tom, come on preach,
Let the one of which you speak have his way
Let his precious will be done
Preacher Tom, come on
Teach of the one always in reach
Saying who so ever will let him come
Preach on preacher Tom, preach on
Your smile is like the sunshine bringing warmth and joy to others
And love controls your understanding heart
And the message that you spread is just like water to the thirsty
A beacon that keeps shining through the dark
So preacher Tom, come on preach,
Let the one of which you speak have his way
Let his precious will be done
Preacher Tom, come on
Teach of the one always in reach
Saying who so ever will let him come
Preach on preacher Tom, preach on
So preacher Tom, come on preach,
Let the one of which you speak have his way
Let his precious will be done
Preacher Tom, come on
Teach of the one always in reach
Saying who so ever will let him come
Preach on preacher Tom, preach on"
"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you,
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling ""Yoo hoo,""
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
Let's go, Let's look at the show,
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
It's grand, Just holding your hand,
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land.
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you."
"They say that it's a matter of trusting
Before love has a chance to begin
And it's never simple
Faithless hearts can cripple
And only a strong love survives
I know they say that it's a fine line
Between giving up and giving in
But once your heart's been in it
You just can't forget it
It's like nothing that you've felt in your life
[Chorus:]
We got real love
Not infatuation
Real love
Our hearts' celebration
I love you
Real love
Not an imitation
Real love
You're my destination
Baby, you and me
We got everything we need
You are such a part of my life
That I can't remember me without you
And we've had our nights
We've had our share of fights
But we've never thought of giving it up
Oh, you and I we must be dreamers
'Cause we're making our dreams come true
I could spend my life
Just holding you so tight
And never, ever get enough
[Chorus]
We got real love
[Repeat Chorus]"
"(Dolly Parton)
We sang a love song the day that we met
You thought that we made the perfect duet
You liked my performance so you wanted to know
If I would stay on as the star of the show
And beautiful music we made for a time 'til she changed our tune
And you added new lines
Our duet arrangement became a trio
Now you want a star, but I just think you should know
I don't play second fiddle in nobody's band
And I'm no back-up singer and I won't be a fan
And I'm nobody's co-star
I just play leading rolls
And I don't want the part, don't want a part
Won't play a part unless it's star of the show
Oh, she's stealing the show that's been so dear to my heart
She's changing our song 'til I'm not sure of my part
She sharing the spotlight and there's not room for both
Now one or the other is the star of the show, the other goes
Life is a show and the show will go on
The world is stage, loves an act we perform
There's always some new act somewhere up the road
And I'll always be staring in somebodies' show
I don't play second fiddle in nobody's band
And I'm no back-up singer and I won't be a fan
And I'm nobody's co-star
I just play leading rolls
And I don't want the part, don't want a part
Won't play a part unless it's star of the show
I don't play second fiddle in nobody's band
And I'm no back-up singer and I won't be a fan
And I'm nobody's co-star
I just play leading rolls
And I don't want the part, don't want a part
Won't play a part unless it's star of the show
If I don't star in your show
Well I'm still a star and I can still go
You know I got to be, I got to be the star of the show"
"Friends ask how I'll get along without you they say it's so sad we're apart
I have to agree that I don't seem like me I'm havin' a ball with my heart
Anything's better than nothing nothing's not too much to lose
Anything's better than nothing nothing's what I have with you
I've got to admit that it hurts me I don't like to fight or to fuss
But now you and me are just happy we're free and everyone's crying but us
Anything's better than nothing...
It really must be disappointment to see love and dream turn to smoke
I can't blame my friends when their teardrops begin
I once thought that love made a home
Anything's better than nothing...
Nothing's what I have with you..."
"Crushed velvet drapes the walls of the room
Pillows all colors shapes and sizes on the floor
Mirrors on the ceiling reflect the candles burning low
Just close your eyes and travel anyplace you want to go
To lover's lane or far away to the mountain peaks of Spain
Crise along the Amazon where the deep blue waters flow
Our imagination will take us anyplace you want to go
[ steel - fiddle ]
Though we can only go there in our minds
Cause we cannot afford such luxuries so kind
The little room we live in is not much we both know
But the dreams we share can take us anyplace we want to go
Tonight we'll go to some majestic island
Ride the waves when the tie is rising
Lying in the silver sands where gentle breezes blow
The beauty of our love can take anyplace we want to go
To lover's lane or far away...
Anyplace you want to go"
"I ain't got no business here
You have made it very clear
So I'm leaving
Leaving this old town
My wings are kinda broken up
But I think I might can patch 'em up
Heaven help me
Lord, you got an angel down
Time and only time can tell
If I'm to find Heaven or Hell
Then I'm leaving
I'm just leaving
I have given all I can
I've tried but you don't understand
So I'm leaving
I'm talking big for someone so small
I know I'll be alright out there
Even so, I'm just a little scared
But that's strictly just between us
And that's all
I'm gonna be alright
I'm going to Paradise
I'm leaving
Just leaving
Time and only time can tell
If I'm to find Heaven or Hell
But I'm leaving
I'm just leaving
My wings are kinda broken up
But I think I might can patch 'em up
Heaven help me
Lord, you've got an angel down
I'm leaving
I'm leaving this old town
Leaving
I'm leaving
Lord, you've an angel down
I'm leaving this old town
I'm just leaving"
"I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love with a girl,
That's what's the matter with me
I'm in love,
I'm in love, with a beautiful girl,
But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,
How I sighed and I cried
But she just refused
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,""
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone
I'm yearning for it yet
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy""
Twas just a beautiful dream
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome
and get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,""
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone
I'm yearning for it yet
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy
Twas just a beautiful dream"
"There's a bit of magic in a simple little smile
Something that just makes life seem a little more worthwhile
And there's a world of meaning in the touch of someone's hand
A gentle touch that let's your brother know you understand
Oh, if people would stop taking and just once try to give
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live
La la la la la la la la la la la la
And if we'd love one another instead of finding faults
We could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs
Oh, wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony
Everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me
La la la la la la la la la la la la
All life has to offer that's what most folks desire
But offer nothing in return 'cause they don't seem to care
And if we'd ask to be forgiven and be willing to forgive
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live
And if we'd all climb together, we could climb the highest hill
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live
And if we'd love one another instead of finding faults
We could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs
Oh, wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony
Everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me
La la la la la la la la la la la la"
"In grave in my mind there are pictures mem'ries of a love I knew one time
So I find in my thoughts I stand looking
At the mem'ries hanging on the walls of my mind
I see a mem'ry of raindrops falling in the park on the day we met
Walking with each other through the rain laughing talking as we both got soak and wet
The mem'ry made that day I could never put away
That's the day he told me he'd be mine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
And I have a mem'ry of springtime cherry blossoms and bird singing on the vine
And the secret place we'd hide and laid together side by side
And the love that shined so brightly in his eyes
Springtime I recall was the sweetest time of all
That's the season our hearts became entwine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
Through the spring and summer he loved me and his love died with autumn leaves
His love was the wild and restless kind
When he left he left with me so many memories
He left them hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
Mhm mhm hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
He left them hanging on my mind"
"I woke up this morning in a strange place
I looked into the mirror at a strange face
Then I looked for you but you could not be found
And then I felt the lonely comin' down
I walked across the room to the empty bed
Saw the imprint on the pillow where you laid your head
The presence of you still lingered all around
And once again I felt the lonely comin' down
Then I felt the lonely dripping down my face
As I realized no one could take your place
I wondered where the love had gone that we had found
And then again I felt the lonely comin' down
I wondered where the love had gone that we had found
And again I felt the lonely comin' down
Mmm..."
"You ask me not to wear cologne
Shell know youve been with me alone
And you cant take our secret home
So you ask me not to wear cologne
You can wipe the make up off
The lipstick or a little gloss
But fragrance lingers on and on
So you ask me not to wear cologne
You leave my bed and go to hers
Leaving me alone and hurt
I love you whether right or wrong
And you ask me not to wear cologne
Im not out to hurt someone
Not you, not her, not any one
But I got heartaches of my own
Why, I cant even wear cologne
Oh but I never meant for this to be
It wasnt in my heart to cheat
Love has a nature all it's own
So I willingly gave up cologne
And every time you come to me
I realize Im in too deep
I know you love us both and I keep holding on
You ask me not to wear cologne
You say, Dont wear cologne
Oh now what am I ever gonna do
Cause I am so in love with you
I know you love us both
But where do I belong
You ask me not to wear cologne
You ask me not to wear cologne
Shell know youve been with me alone
And you cant take our secret home
So you ask me not to wear cologne
How do I walk away from the greatest love Ive known
You ask me not to wear cologne
Oh you ask me not to wear cologne
You ask me not to wear cologne
Shell know youve been with me alone
And Im a scent you cant take home
But will I ever get to wear cologne"
"There's a land that is fairer than day
And by faith we can see it afar
For the Father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there
[Chorus:]
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blessed
And our spirit shall sorrow no more
Not a sign for the blessing of rest
[Chorus x 2]"
"[Chorus]
I've been higher than the high sierra
Lower than death valley must be
I've been right, mostly wrong
Wrong about you, right about me
The way I feel, can't explain
So much passion turned to pain
The sun still shines most of the time
Did you know the sun shines when it rains
[Chorus]
I've been cussed and I've been praised
And I've been nothing these days
But I'll come back, time will see
If I'm wrong about you, right about me"
"(Dolly Parton)
I open up my door to greet the early morning sun
Closing it behind me and away I do run
To the meadow where the meadow lark is singing in the tree
In the meadow I go walking in the early morning breeze
I cup my hands to catch a multi-colored butterfly
Perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild
Freeing it I watch it as it flies away from me
To visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze
Rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
Drops of morning dew still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze
Misty-eyed I look about the meadow where I stray
For its there I find the courage to greet the coming day
For there among the flowers I kneel gently to my knees
To have a word with God in the early mornig breeze"
"(Dolly Parton)
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus, I'll tell you why I do
'Cause I believe that dreams and plans and wishes can come true
I believe in miracles, I believe in magic too
Oh I believe in Santa Claus and I believe in you
I believe in family, in country and in smiles
I believe in turnin' negatives to positives in life
I believe in lookin' farther up the farther down we get
I believe when someone hurts us we should forgive and forget
And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe love should prevail at any cost
And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in saying what you mean and meaning what you say
I believe a better attitude can make a better way
And I believe in viewing life as a journey that we're on
And lookin' at our troubles as another stepping stone
And I believe that everything in life is what it's meant to be
I believe there is a God somewhere although he's hard to see
I believe I am so therefore I should do all that I can
To be a better piece in the puzzle of God's plan
And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
And I believe in Santa Claus
Let the little children sing it
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus
Let the whole world sing it with us
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus
Let the whole world sing it with us
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
I believe in Santa Claus"
"What are we doing in this place alone
Is our desire to relive our past this strong
The love we knew in the past is gone but our weakness lingers on
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
Long ago we let the flame of love burn out of control
Now we have no reason to reach for love that has grown cold
If we live our past in the present our future will be gone
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
[ fiddle ]
Line with temptation we raced into the past
On a road too small to let the past and the present pass
Are we going too fast to turn back and leave the past alone
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong
Long ago we let the flame...
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong"
"As I sit here tonite the jukebox's playin
The song about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words they are saying
It brings memories when I was a trusted wife
It was not God who made Honky Tonk Angels
As you said in the words of you're song
Too many times married men think, they're still single
And that's why many a poor girl do go wrong
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame
It was not God who made HTA
As you said in the words of you're song
Too many times married men think, they're still single
And that's why many a poor girl do go wrong"
"(Dolly Parton)
Spent all my money on everyone else
Why I just kept handing it out right and left
They didn't appreciate none of my help
I have found
Had me a man
I was so much in love
But he just walked off after using me up
I cried like a baby
It hurt me so much and I'm down
Yeah, I'm sure down
I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up
I just need some time
Just need a little streak of good luck
And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am
You try to do right but tell me where does that get you
People just use you and then they forget you
Well it wont take me long
To get my feet back on solid ground
But now I'm down
When I get my life back in order again
Well I'll still be willing to help out my friends
And if you need some body or wished it had been, look around
I'll be spending my money on everyone else
Well I'll just be handing it out right and left
I'll find a new love i wont live by myself
I'm just down, now, yeah I'm down
I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up
I just need some time
Just need a little streak of good luck
And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am
You try to do right but tell me where does that get you
People just use you and then they forget you
Well it wont take me long
To get my feet back on solid ground
But now I'm down
I know that I'm down
But I'm bound to get up"
"(Dolly Parton)
I feel so out of place here
With this high society
These high fallutin' people
Don't know what to make of me
I feel like a minnow in a sea of Moby Dicks
A small fry in a big pan
They're caviar -- I'm fish sticks
Fish out of water
I know I don't belong
Fish out of water
Everything I do is wrong
My style of hair, the clothes I wear
The way I speak, the things I eat
The way I act, my lack of tact
Nothin' seems to fit
Fish out of water
Flounderin' round
Out of my element
But I'm just as good as they are
Why do I feel second rate
It's like, ""Sorry Charlie,
We want only tuna with good taste""
I guess you could say Wal-Mart
Is quite a way from Gucci's
I'm Timex, they're Rolex
I'm Captain D's, they're sushi
Fish out of water
I've had it to the gills
Fish out of water
With these yuppie-guppie frills
Yeah, I'm a square in a round hole
A catfish in a goldfish bowl
A little fish with lots of soul
Out of my element
Fish out of water
Flounderin' round just for the Halibut
Save me, save me
S.O.S. somebody
Save me, save me
Somebody rescue me
Fish out of water
Somebody throw me in
Fish out of water
On a scale of one to ten
I'm a two, perhaps a three
Compared to the big fish in the sea
I'm washed ashore so save me please
I'm in an awful fix
Fish out of water
Rescue me
And you better do it quick
Fish out of water
It's such a culture shock
Fish out of water
My stomach's tied in knots
Fish out of water
Fish out of water"
"(Dolly Parton)
Daddy I feel that I must talk to you
Are you sure this is what you want to do?
Now it's not for us kids that I beg you to stay
Please don't just walk out on Mama this way
She's mothered your children, she's spent her whole life
Trying to be a good mother and wife
And she stood by you when the rest let you down
Daddy, how can you walk out on her now?
I'm your oldest daughter, my age twenty-three
Your new love is even younger than me
She's young, she's pretty, her hands soft as dew
While Mama's are withered from working for you
Mom's not young any more like your new love
But your new love won't love you like my mama does
You've taken her best years, so don't leave her now
Please, Daddy say that you won't let her down"
"(Dolly Parton)
Chorus:
I'm the queen of the sleazy tabloids
I rule the trashy kingdom
Like Lady Di they make sure I am never left alone
Papparazzi and reporters stalk me from the shadows
Making sure to keep my royal assetts on my throne
Oh they talk about the lovers
That I keep undercover
And I wish that I was as much fun
As they have you believe
Just like Alec Baldwin
I'd love to whack 'em all one
But instead I'll wait and see
Who I am sleepin' with next week
I'm the queen of the sleazy tabloids
And I rule the trashy kingdom
But the rumors raise my cue score
And pay for my big home
I guess I 'augt to sue them
But instead I guess I'll use them
To keep me in the spotlight
And keep me on my throne
Cause I'm the queen of the sleazy tabloids"
"(Dolly Parton)
We might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank
We fed ourselves from the fruit of the land
And quenched our thirst with rain
We never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet
Life just had no pattern for Gypsy Joe and me
All we had was each other and the rags upon our back
The closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack
But we had all we needed and the rest we didn't need
Life was free and simple for Gypsy Joe and me
Now Gypsy was my little dog, I found by the road in a ditch
And so I named him Gypsy, cause that name just seemed to fit
Oh and Joe he was my man, the flower of my soul
Thou he never said he loved me, I just always seemed to know
While standing by the highway, thumbin' for a ride
The speeding wheels of a passing car, took Gypsy's life
I lost him where I found him and his loss was misery
Now there's no more Gypsy, there's just Joe and me
Well the winter came and the snow did fall
And the night was cold and still
And the rags we wore were not enough
And Joe he caught the chill
And he told me how he loved me
And in my arms he went to sleep
Now there's no more Gypsy, no more Joe, there's just me
While standin' here on the edge of this bridge
Lookin' down I see
The face of Joe and Gypsy, lookin' back at me
And somewhere in the distance I can hear them callin' me
Tonight we'll be together again
Gypsy, Joe and me"
"Back home, back home
Yes, I'm going back home
Why I can't believe it's been this long
Since I've seen mom and dad
When I left my mountain home behind
I left them both so sad
My brothers and my sisters that were babies then are grown
Years have past and now at last, I'm on my way back home
Back home, back home
Yes I'm going back home
To the factory smoke and city life, I'm sayin' so long
I've shed a lot of tears through all the years that I've been gone
And I've spent a lot of time a' wishin' I could go back home
I got a letter from mama an'
Mama asked me if I'd come back home
She says it sure is lonesome now
Since all of us kids are all growed up and gone
I just can't hardly stand the thoughts of
Momma and daddy being left there all alone
That's really all I need to know
And now I'm on the road back home
Back home, back home
Yes, I'm going back home
To the smog an' smoke an' city life, I'm sayin' so long
I've shed a lot of tears through all the years that I've been gone
And I've spent a lot of time a' wishin' I could go back home"

I give an inch and you take a mile and you tell me to jump and I just ask how
high
I've been over backwards to show you I care
And someone must always give more than their share
I say I'm sorry when the fault is not mine
And I take the blame for our fights all the time
I love you so much and it doesnt seem fair
That someone must always give more than their share
I know you well enough to know you would never admit you were wrong
And you know me well enough to know I give in cause my love is so strong
If I give an inch and you take a mile if you tell me to jump well I just ask
how high
I've been over backwards to show you I care
Cause someone must always give more than their share
Yes someone must always give more than their share"

In my home town of Blackie, Kentucky
He came passin' through one dark, gloomy day
And I considered myself as lucky
When he told me he would take me away
And though he was older, it made me no difference
His promise of riches was all I could see
At last I could leave the coal mines of Kentucky
And know something better than sad poverty
Blackie, Kentucky, you know that I'll miss you
But there are other places in the world I'd like to see
So I must take this chance to be somethin' more than nothin'
But I'll always hold you in my memory
But I've never adjusted to sociable livin'
The friends that he knows, they're all strangers to me
Thousands of miles from Blackie, Kentucky
In a mansion with a husband that never loved me
He won't let my family and friends come to visit
Because they are country and poor, he's ashamed
Oh, but I'd give my life, Lord, if I could just go see them
All that's changed about me is my name
Blackie, Kentucky, oh Lord, how I miss you
If I could come back home, I'd never leave you anymore
I'd like to see my poor, hardworking, coal-minin' Daddy
And Mama, and the kids, and the friends I knew before
My world is as black as the coal in Kentucky
He won't let me leave him - there's no way to win
I'll take my own life, dear God, please forgive me
But I've got to get back home to Blackie once again
An' I've left him a note, in the mornin' he'll find it
It's my last request and he can't refuse me
I've told him to bury me back in Blackie, Kentucky
Where my family and my friends can come and visit me
Blackie, Kentucky I'm comin' home to you
But different from the way you remember me before
So make me a place and I'll lay me down to rest
And I'll sleep in your arms forevermore
I'll sleep in your arms forever more"
"Hurt is no stranger to me
And oh how well I know misery
You've always hurt me
But I always forgive
And I'll hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
Oh it's my fault for loving you so deeply
I'd give you my love completely
I'd give you love but hurt is all you give
And I hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
For as long as I love you, there'll be pain
Though tears come and go
My love remains the same
I'll always forgive you
You know that I will
And I hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
Yes I've hurt for as long as I loved you
And I'll love you for as long as I live"
"How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
Yes, and how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till we know
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
It's blowin' in the wind
Blowin', blowin' in the wind
How many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Blowin', blowin' in the wind
Blowin', it's blowin' in the wind
Blowin', it's blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind"
"There is no love and there is no hate
There is no feeling at all
I look at you and you look at me
But we might as well stare at the wall
Cause you don't see me and I don't see you
Just a shadow of love that is gone
There is no love and there is no hate
No reason to hurry home
There's no tiny hands to reach out to us
No plans bein' made anymore
We have no tomorrow our future is gone
There's only sadness in store
We don't care enough to even ask questions
And when we're together we still feel alone
There is no love and there is no hate
No reason to hurry home
There is nothing to look forward to
No reason to hurry home"
"Well, I heard about it
That kind of need that keeps a person sleepless
All that dreaming just the same
And I read about it
I've just decide if someone leaves you breathless
But I never felt that way now I feel It
I'm not so sure I like it
But I feel it consume it be
And it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony, sweet agony, sweet agony
If you had it planned out to give yourself halfway
And leave me wanting more right here on the brink
Well, your time just ran out I've got to hide it all
What are you waiting for
I'm too afraid to think what this thing is
I'm not so sure I like it that expenses just killing me
And it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony, sweet agony, sweet agony
I want the real thing tired of daydreams
And don't you tease me anymore
You've got the real thing to keep me waiting
I never felt like this before
And it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Oh, it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you"
"(Dolly Parton)
We once were so close now the love light
That glowed has now gone out of our eyes
And the good life we had for some reason went bad
And the love that once lived here has died
How did we get here, where did it start
When did we walk out of each other's hearts
Where did we lose it, how did love die
When, where, and how, but most of all why
Most of all, why did we let love die
Like the withering leaves in the fall
And why did we wait 'til it was to late
To realize how much we lost
How did we get here, where did it start
When did we walk out of each other's hearts
Where did we lose it, how did love die
When, where, and how, but most of all why"
"Peace in the valley for me some day
Well, I'm tired and so weary, but I must travel on
'Til the Lord comes and calls me away, oh, yes
Where the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night is as bright as the day, oh, yes
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
Only peace in the valley for me, oh, yes
Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh, yes
And the beasts from the wild shall be led by a little child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh, yes"
"As night falls around us love's tender embrace replaces the sun's golden light
Then love show us beauty that only love can describe love you're so beautiful tonight
As you fill our hearts with tenderness and emotions inside
Lost in each other with the world closed outside
Oh this must be like heaven it's heaven to you and I love you're so beautiful tonight
Your nearness in the silence your rapid heartbeat
Your face touching mine then you whisper on my cheek
I'll love you till the stars in the heavens lose their lights
Oh love you're so beautiful tonight
As you fill our hearts...
I'll love you till the stars..."
"In a shingle covered cottage at the foothills of blue stacks
Near a mountain stream that's flowing crystal clear
Where the humming birds and honey bees feed on Mama's roses
My mem'ries just grow sweeter with the years
Mem'ries of my childhood are as sweet as mountain honey
And as fresh as a dew on morning glory vines
I grew up surrounded by the sights and sounds of nature
And they're forever present in my mind
But I'm headed in the wrong direction home
Headed in the wrong direction home
There's no place like home
But I'm headed in the wrong direction home
Teardrops mingled with the summer rain that was a falling
The day I left my mountain home behind
With a suitcase in my hand and a hope in my heart
I was following a dream I had to find
In that shingled covered cottage at the foothills of the smokies
Waits a family hat I'm longing to see
And mountain streams and fields of green
And rolling hills stay in my dreams
But I'm many, many miles from Tennessee"
"(Dolly Parton)
Like the Phoenix
From the ash and dirt
I rose up from the pain and hurt
When I was at my very worst
I found you
Thought I could never love again
When a spark of light came beaming in
A thread of hope
For me to spin around you
Chorus:
Unlikely Angel
Standing there in front of me
As if you were my destiny
Like we were always meant to be together
Unlikely Angel
It feels so right inside your love
Like God has sent you from above
To honor, cherish, and to love forever
The smile upon your angel face
The heaven in your eyes replace
The hell that I've been going through
Before you
How long have you been there for me
I once was blind but now I see
A future full of hope
How I adore you
Repeat Chorus
Unlikely Angel
Oh, you never know where one might be
In sacred halls or crowded streets
But God has sent one straight down to me from heaven
Unlikely Angel
Unlikely Angel
Unlikely Angel
Unlikely Angel
Hmmmm
Whisper:
Unlikely Angel"
"(Dolly Parton)
The word ""If"", just two tiny letters
Says so much for something so small
The biggest little word in existence;
Never answers, just questions us all
If regrets were gold, I'd be rich as a queen
If teardrops were diamonds, how my face would gleam
If I'd loved you better, I wouldn't be lonely
If only, if only, if only
But looking back now I see clearly
With my twenty-twenty hindsight
Oh, but don't think I haven't paid dearly,
'Cause you could be in my arms tonight
If regrets were gold, I'd be rich as a queen
If teardrops were diamonds, how my face would gleam
How I let you go, I swear is beyond me
But if only; ah, if only; oh, if only
I could start over, if I could go back
Have the power to change things
Then I would do that
But I listened to others like a fool,
Oh, shame on me
But if only you would just come back
If only, dare I even ask
Oh, if only"
"(Dolly Parton)
A broken heart like a broken wing
It must have its time to mend
I am like a crippled bird
In hopes one day to fly again
I loved you so and I was faithful
I cared more than words could say
But love is cruel and life is hateful
Now you've gone and flown away
Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure
Slow to heal, but quick to cry
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly
Oh, the loss is cold and shameful
And the grief so deep and sharp
There is nothing quite as painful
As a true blue broken heart
Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure
Slow to heal, but quick to cry
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly"
"(Dolly Parton)
Mother's hold on to your sons and you daughters
Should Hollywood claim them, you'll hold then no more
Cause they'll become claimed to the Hollywood potters
And there's no escape once they walk through that door
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama
Center of sorrow, city of schemes
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams
Some, they go hungry and some go insane
Some go to the bottle and some to the vains
Some become users and some become used
And some even make it, but most never do
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama
Center of sorrow, city of schemes
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams
You spin them around like a merry-go-round
You mold them and shape them and then throw them down
All of your glitter and all of your gold
Is that what you give in exchange for a soul
Cause they sell their soles for the likes of you
While you chew up and spit out what you cannot use
Mother's hold on to your sons and you daughters
Should Hollywood claim them, you'll hold then no more
Cause they'll become claimed to the Hollywood potters
And there's no escape once they walk through that door
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama
Center of sorrow, city of schemes
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams"
"Why why why did you say goodbye
Why did you walk out on me
Cry cry cry I feel like I could die
Why did you go and leave me lonely
What did I do
What did I say
To make you just walk out and leave me this way
Please come back and tell me
What I did wrong
And I'll make it up to you
If you'll just come back home
I'll try try try as each day goes by
To make you glad that you came back to me
No more good-byes and no more tears to cry
Every day I'll try to make you happy
What did I do
What did I say
To make you just walk out and leave me this way
Please come back and tell me
What I did wrong
And I'll make it up to you
If you'll just come back home
I'll try try try as each day goes by
To make you glad that you came back to me
No more good-byes and no more tears to cry
Every day I'll try to make you happy"
"(Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner)
Oh, the pain of loving you
Oh, the misery I go through
Never knowing what to do
Oh, the pain of loving you
You just can't stand to see me happy
Seems you hurt me all you can
Still I go on loving you
But I never understand
To love and hate at the same time
The line between the two is fine
The two have bound me heart and soul
So strong that I can't let you go"
"Love it's not I who didn't try
Hard enough, hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough
Love you don't see
The pain in me
That's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cried for us, I cried for us
I'll take my share but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff
Easy enough
And if you choose I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough
I've tried and tried to put aside
The time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked"
"They say the love 'bove will get you at the age of twenty-three
Well I'm not tellin' my age but something got a hold on me
I'm just cravin' some lovin' in the old fashion way
Honey linger near and listen to all I had to say
Why don't you haul off and love me one more time
Why don't you squeeze me until I'm turning blind
If you don't cuddle off and love me like I want you to do
I'm gonna haul off and die over you
[ steel ]
I can feel your warm lips near me hear you breathe so soft and fine
I can feel the matrimony crawling up and down my spine
I don't believe this love will hurt you cause it feels so nice and kind
It seems mighty close to heaven when your love is on the line
Why don't you haul off and love me...
I'm a gonna haul off and die over you"

"Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you
Close the door to temptation
don't let me walk through
Turn away from me, darling
I'm begging you to
Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you
I belong to another
Whose arms have grown cold
But i promised forever
To have and to hold
I can never be free, dear
But when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing
The will to be true
Please help me, I'm falling
And that would be sin
Close the door to temptation
don't let me walk in
For i mustn't want you
But, darling, i do
Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you"
"I'm a brave little soldier
I must be bold and strong
A brave little soldier
And I must carry on
I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
I'm a brave little soldier
I must fight, I must win
I'm a brave little soldier
Through hell and back again
I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
Per rum, pum, pum
Per rum, pum, pum
Per rum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Ye though I am marching through the valley filled with fear
My steps are sure and sturdy and my aim is straight and clear
The enemy is stalking me just waiting for the kill
Like david slewed galiath
I will claim this battle field
I'm a brave little soldier
I must do what I can
I'm a brave little soldier
And I must take a stand
I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
Marching, marching onward
Searching out the light of truth
I did not start the war
But it's a battle I can't lose
Faith will be my armor
And love my sword and shield
I must defeat the enemy
I will, I will, I will
A brave little soldier
I must be bold and strong
A brave little soldier
And I must carry on
A brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
Brave, little soldier"
"Once more to be with you dear
Just for tonight to hold you tight
Once more I'd give a fortune
If I could see you once more
Forget the past this hurt can't last
So I don't want it to keep us apart
Your love I need say you'll love me
And say you'll give me all of your heart
Once more to be with you dear...
Once more to be with you dear..."
"As I sit here tonight, the jukebox playin'
The tune about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words you are sayin'
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men
Think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start
Most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men
Think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong"
"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
[Chorus]
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town"

Come back to me
Come back and say you're still in love with me
Come back and say that I am all you'll ever need
Baby come back come back to me
Oh please come back to me
Come back and say you'll work it out with me
Come back to stay and say you're never gonna leave
Baby come back, come back to me
Oh and kiss me once again as only you can
Touch me like nobody else can do
Oh, oh, and hold me and show me you're still my man
And that you didn't need somebody new
Oh come back to me
Come back and hold this torch that's burning me
Come back and promise me eternity
Baby come back, won't you come back to me?
Kiss me once again as only you can
Touch me like nobody else can do
Oh, oh, oh, and hold me and show me you're still my man
And that you didn't need somebody new
Oh, come back to me
Come back and mend this broken heart in me
Without your love I know I'll never be complete
Baby come back, won't you come back to me
Oh please come back to me
Baby come back, baby come back to me
Baby come back, come back and say I'm all you need
Come back, won't you come back to me
Come back to me
Come back and say you're still in love with me
Come back and say that I am all you'll ever need
Baby come back won't you come back to me
Oh, please come back to me
Come back and hold this torch that's burning me
Come back and promise me eternity..."
"I don't want to hear a love song
I got on this airplane just to fly
I know there's life below me
And all that you can show me is the prairie and the sky
I don't want to hear a sad story filled with heartbreak and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain in the night
And I watched it burn, I watched it burn, I watched it burn
I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in a saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, see your face
Well you really got me this time
And the hardest part is knowing I survive
And I've come to listen to the sounds of trucks
As they moved out on Highway 95
And pretending it's the ocean coming to wash me clear
To wash me clear if you know what I mean
I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in a saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, see your face"
"Oh Lord my God when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made
Now I see the stars and I hear the rolling thunder
Thy art throughout the universe displayed
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art oh
How great Thou art
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation
To take me home what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall kneel in humble adoration and there proclaim my God
How great Thou art
Then sings my soul"
"I couldn't believe it the day that you left
Cleaned out your closet, cleared off your shelves
Loaded your car and you drove out of sight
But I never said goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open, I leave on a light
I'm always waiting in case you drop by
I'll never say goodbye
People have told me you have a new love
My heart's not willing to give up on us
I've convinced myself they're just telling me lies
And I'll never say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open, I leave on a light
I never wanted you out of my life
And I'll never say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open, I leave on a light
I'll be loving you till the day that I die
And I'll never say goodbye
If you'll just come back, I won't even ask why
I'll never say goodbye, no, I'll never say goodbye"
"Peace in the valley for me some day
Well, I'm tired and so weary, but I must travel on
'Til the Lord comes and calls me away, oh, yes
Where the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night is as bright as the day, oh, yes
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
Only peace in the valley for me, oh, yes
Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh, yes
And the beasts from the wild shall be led by a little child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh, yes"
"Tonight my heart is sad and weary
Wonderin' if I'm wrong or right
I dream about you though you've left me
I wonder where you are tonight
The rain is cold and slowly fallin'
Upon my window pane tonight
And though you're love was even colder
I wonder where you are tonight
It's spring, the birds are gaily singing
The trees are blossoming so sweet
No other love was quite so happy
No other love was so complete
The rain is cold and slowly fallin'
Upon my window pane tonight
And though you're love was even colder
I wonder where you are tonight
Then came the dawn the day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me
It still lingers in my heart tonight
Oh, the rain is cold and slowly fallin'
Upon my window pane tonight
And though you're love is even colder
I wonder where you are tonight"
"In a shingle covered cottage at the foothills of blue stacks
Near a mountain stream that's flowing crystal clear
Where the humming birds and honey bees feed on Mama's roses
My mem'ries just grow sweeter with the years
Mem'ries of my childhood are as sweet as mountain honey
And as fresh as a dew on morning glory vines
I grew up surrounded by the sights and sounds of nature
And they're forever present in my mind
But I'm headed in the wrong direction home
Headed in the wrong direction home
There's no place like home
But I'm headed in the wrong direction home
Teardrops mingled with the summer rain that was a falling
The day I left my mountain home behind
With a suitcase in my hand and a hope in my heart
I was following a dream I had to find
In that shingled covered cottage at the foothills of the smokies
Waits a family hat I'm longing to see
And mountain streams and fields of green
And rolling hills stay in my dreams
But I'm many, many miles from Tennessee"
"(A wish that Malena had wings)
Malena for hours would run in the meadow
Well Malena would go to play every day
She chased butterflies and she'd say with the smile
If I had wings I could fly that away
Malena would cry when we try to explain
That little girl's world's supposed to have wings
That only in heaven can little girls fly
We'd see a strange look in Malena's eyes
(A wish that Malena had wings)
We'll always remember Malena's last birthday
Boxes with bright colored ribbon and string
And the wish that she made as she blew out the candles
A wish that Malena had wings
And with all the gifts that we bought for Malena
The wish that she made we could not satisfy
But on the night of her birthday the angels fullfilled it
They gave her wings and now Malena can fly"
"I've been sittin' here looking at the clock big daddy
Allready you're a half hour late.
I've been pulling back the curtains, peeping out the window
Wish you wouldn't make me wait
You better move it on home, boy, you better move it on home.
I've been sittin' here listening to the jukebox playing
And forgettin' where I ought to be.
Zipping on a cool one having me some good fun
Time got away from me.
I better move it on home, I better move it on home.
[Chorus]
Better spin them wheels and make it on back
To heaven on earth and lovers' at
Like a rolling stone, you better move it on home.
I've been here cooking you a nice hot supper
And you can't even eat it on time
Heating up the meat loaf and stiring up the gravy
Is kind a messing up my mind
You better move it on home boy, you better move it on home.
I've been speeding through the traffic, passing everyone
I remember what I forgot.
Stepping on the gas and driving kind of fast
Hoping I won't get stopped.
Better move it on home, better move it on home.
[Chorus: x 2]
She: Better move it on home, boy right on this time or I'm gonna shake it.
He: I'm on my way babe, but the traffic is murder
She: That's what I thought the trouble is at home, if you're not at home soon.
He: Traffic is messing up my mind
She: ... and you're messing up mine."
"We'd get up before sun-up to get the work done up
We'd work in the fields till the sun had gone down
We've stood and we've cried as we have bristly watched
A hailstorm a' beatin' our crops to the ground
We've gone to bed hungry many nights in the past
In the good old days when times were bad
Chorus:
No amount of money could buy from me
The memories that I have of then
No amount of money could pay me
To go back and live through it again
I've seen daddy's hands break open and bleed
And I've seen him work till he's stiff as a board
An' I've seen momma layin' in suffer and sickness
In need of a doctor we couldn't afford
Anything at all was more than we had
In the good old days when times were bad
We've got up before and found ice on the floor
Where the wind would blow snow through the cracks in the wall
And I couldn't enjoy then, havin' a boyfriend
I had nothing decent to wear at all
So I long for a love that I never had
In the good old days when times were bad
Repeat chorus
Tag:
In the good old days when times were bad
In the good old days when times were bad"
"So often in my dreams
I hold you close against my skin
Waking up I wish that I could
Sleep and dream again
Cause only when I sleep
Can I not hear how it's a sin
How cheaters never win
Their heartaches never end
""Torn Between Two Lovers"" on the jukebox
And I'm thinking how I could've wrote that song
Wonderin' if God loves us, when we're cheatin'
But why he lets us feels things if it's wrong
I guess I should be singing ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"", some of those good songs
Can't find it in my heart to ask forgiveness
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
Thou shalt not commit it
It's written in the tin
The spirit is always willing
But the flesh is weak again
And you're as close to heaven
As I might ever fly
An angel in disguise
A wrong that feels so right
And Torn Between Two Lovers just keeps playing
And I don't wanna be right if lovin' you is wrong
It goes against all I've ever stood for
Knowin' I have someone else at home
I guess I should be singing ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"", some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart can tell on me tomorrow
Cause anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
To hell with heaven if it means I'll lose you
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
It just can't be"
"Let's live for tonight dear it's better that way tomorrow we might be apart
Let's live for tonight dear let love let its way
For tomorrow we could have two broken hearts
Lets cast all our worries and heartaches inside forget what the future might hold
Let's live for tonight dear in a world all our own
For tomorrow we may have to be alone
Let's live for tonight dear and try to pretend that we will never be alone
No matter what happened this night will be ours
What tomorrow brings nobody ever knows
For tomorrow we may have to be alone"
"You kindle the fire of love inside me
Each time our lips meet
I'm not strong when we're alone
Your kisses make me weak
You must know how I feel
But do you feel the same
Everytime you kiss me
You add fuel to the flame
My eyes light up when I see you
I burn with desire
Each time you're near
You say you'll care
But still I'm not sure
But please don't ask me to love you
If you're not gonna change my name
Everytime you touch me
You add fuel to the flame
This fire you started inside me
Has reached my very soul
You're adding fuel to a flame
That's already burning out of control
When you give me your name
I give you everything
Everytime you kiss me
Adds fuel to the flame
Yes everytime you touch me
You add fuel to the flame"
"Baby sister, what a waste to see you in this place
I lose my mind from worrying over you
In a bar room filled with people all higher than a steeple
But I know why you do the things you do
And I curse the man that made you what you are today
I hope he dies a thousand times a thousand ways
Your eyes are filled with tears, sis let's get out of here
'Cause I love you, baby sister, let's go home
And I curse the man that made you what you are today
I hope he dies a thousand times a thousand ways
Your eyes are filled with tears, sis let's get out of here
'Cause I love you, baby sister, let's go home
'Cause I love you, baby sister, let's go home"

A little white house with black wooden shadows
A porch with its columns all covered with vine
My broken dream house where he lives with another
But this was supposed to be mine
Two little children that look like their daddy
With the same smile and the same eyes that shine
The only thing wrong I'm not their mommy
But they were supposed to be mine
He's given to her what he promised to me
The plans that we made never can be
For each night he holds and carresses another
And she is supposed to be me
He's given to her what he promised to me
The plans that we made never can be
For each night he holds and carresses another
And she is supposed to be me"

"You and me and her and him must get together
And see if maybe we can find a way
To put an end to hurting one another
Cause he don't know and she don't know how much we hurt each day
It's not fair and you and I both know it
To have to hide and love the way we do
The time is now that we must get together
Her and him me and you
[ steel - fiddle ]
She and I had lost it long before I met you
We tried and tried but all the love had gone
And I guess respect is all that's kept me with him
Cause there hasn't been no love there in so long
It's not fair and you and I both know it...
Her and him me and you"
"(Billy Joel)
Hey Lord, take a look on around tonight
And find out where my baby's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For he is far away from me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
Make sure that he's gonna be alright
Things gonna be alright with me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
And make sure all his dreams are sweet
Send down that ya got him on the road
But you'll make it softer for his feet
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
Make sure that he's gonna be alright
'Til he's home and here with me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For he is sleeping under the sky
Hey Lord, make sure the ground he's sleepin' on
Is always warm and dry
Ooo, don't give him too much pain
And keep him away from planes
Cause my baby hates to fly
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For it gets rough along the way
And if it all sounds strange
Just because I don't know how to pray
Ooo, won't you give him peace of mind
And if you ever find the time
Tell him I miss him everyday
Hey Lord, take a look on around tonight
And find out where he's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For he is far away from me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
Make sure that he's gonna be alright
'Til he's home and here with me
Here with me"

A different lover ev'ry day
Same old book just a diff'rent page
Same old lines in the same old play
I've got to find somebody I can love all the way
I wanna fall in love, someone that I can live with
I wanna fall in love, someone to take and give with
I wanna fall in love, someone I can be real with
I wanna fall in love
I want someone to be just mine
Someone to be with all the time
A real true love is hard to find
And I don't know where I'll find him
But I've got to keep on tryin' cause
I wanna fall in love, if you hear me, listen to me
I wanna fall in love, I'm undone so come and do me
I wanna fall in love, if you got love, give it to me"
"There's nothing left to tie us to each other anymore
The love we knew is gone and that's a fact we can't ignore
There's nothing left to loose ends on all the ties that bind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
There's no use in wasting the good years that we have left
When we might find happiness with somebody else
There's no chance for us we can see it we're not blind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
The blame belongs to both of us I guess we didn't try
Love is like a garden without care we let it die
The flower of love can't bloom if the sun don't ever shine
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
[ piano ]
The blame belongs to both of us...
Though it hurts we know we must leave it all behind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
You're wasting mine you're wasting mine"
"(Dolly Parton)
Birds sing for everyone but me, for me it rains
And I can't hear the music for the pain
I see such happiness for some, but not for me
With love, I always try so hard to get it right
I find it gone just when I think I might
Regretfully I see it last for some, but not for me
Out of reach of all the things I want to have and hold
I've come to just accept that's how it goes
I've come so close
Not for me, it's not for me to question, I suppose
But I keep wonderin' what the future holds
Why must it be?
That life's so sweet for some, but not for me
Birds sing for everyone but me, for me it rains
And I can't see the sunshine for the pain
But I see such happiness for some, but not for me
For me it rains, there's only pain
It's not for me"
"There's a wreath on the door
She don't live here no more
As of today, she flew home
And we all gathered here
In sorrow and tears
It won't be the same with her gone
There's a place on the hill
That's peaceful and still
Where she'll sleep beside daddy again
The ole' family tree is shedding it's leaves
But we'll all met in heaven again
Chorus:
Oh, she's an angel
Let her fly, let her fly
She's gone home to glory
To her home in the sky
When God sees her comin'
Heaven's choir will smile
And sing, ""oh she's an angel, let her fly, let her fly
Ooh, she's an angel, let her fly""
She used to rock me when I was a child
Sing ""rock of ages"" and ""in the sweet bye and bye""
Her life wasn't easy, oh but how hard she tried
You know she's an angel, lord, so let her fly
Repeat chorus
Tag:
Let her fly
Ooh she's an angel, let her fly"
"(Dolly Parton)
A young couple marries, already fighting
Along comes baby makin' them three
Trouble's all he hears from the time he's in didies
Baby don't know just what to believe
Angry words and spiteful actions
Baby's gonna cut his teeth on these
If that's gonna be the main attraction
What will the baby be, what will baby be
Baby needs love and needs direction
Baby's first school is the family
For they are only a reflection
Of the things they see, what will baby be
What will baby be after baby is grown
What will baby do if baby don't know what's right or wrong
Got to show them love, got to teach them truth
'Cause what baby is when baby grows up
Well, that depends entirely on me and you
Depends entirely on me and you
Baby thinks God is just a curse word
Never said a prayer 'cause he's never been taught
They remember and repeat what they've heard
So I ask who's really at fault
So many questions, so few answers
So many lessons we don't teach
Stumbling through like clumsy dancers
What will baby be, what will baby be
What will baby be after baby is grown
What will baby do when baby is out there on his own
Teach the children how to be all they should be
'Cause what baby is when baby grows up
Depends entirely on you and me
Depends entirely on you and me
What will baby be"
"Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you
Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name
Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me
Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me
Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do
Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can

"(Dolly Parton)
There will come a day when sorrow fades away,
And anguish and heartache shall ease,
No mothers cryin', no soldiers dyin',
And turmoil and misery shall cease.
The hungry shall be fed, the aimless shall be led
And sad eyes will no longer weep,
The last shall be first, through heaven he'll burst
With his heavenly host from the East
Weapons to plowshares, hate turns to love,
Descending from heaven he'll sweep down to us
In radiant splendor; oh, won't it be sweet
When the raven of darkness turns into a white dove of peace
(Raven dove)
Oh, there will come a day when I'll fly away
Forever to be in his keep
Eternal life in the sweet by and by
When raven dove, raven dove speaks
When lambs walk with lions, a child tames the beast
Nations shall gather and bow at his feet
And loved ones shall rise up from their earthly sleep
And he'll separate all the chaff from the wheat.
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, how sweet
When the raven of darkness turns into a white dove of peace
Raven dove, behold he cometh in the clouds
And every eye shall see him
Sweet bird, sweet bird of peace
Raven Dove"
"No we can't control the evil that surround us
But as long as we're together that's enough
If there were just the two of us how different things would be
No one could come between us from now on
The wagging tongues would speak no more the sounds of gossip gone
Without a prying ear to fall upon
No we can't control the evil that surround us
But as long as we're together that's enough
Though we have no power over those around us
We can act as if there's just the two of us
[ steel - fiddle ]
Though clouds of doubt may drift about upon a stormy sea
I'll only draw you nearer onto me
As long as we're together we'll never walk alone
We'll build a world of sunshine of our own
No we can't control the evil that surround us..."
"(Dolly Parton)
When you love somebody with all your heart and soul
And you want to keep them with you, but you know they want to go
What do you do, what do you say
When you know they want to leave
As bad as you want them to stay
And there's nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love
When one doesn't care at all and the other cares too much
It's a sad situation, I must say
When you know they want to leave
As bad as you want them to stay
You know how much I love you
But I know you don't love me
And I know it's just a matter of time before you leave
But I do, I stand aside and just let you walk away
But I know you want to leave
As bad as I want you to stay"
"I saw him picking up the pieces of his broken heart
And so I stopped to see what I could do
His heart had been run over by a reckless lover
She ran over it and broke it and left it black and blue
Tears were scattered everywhere he was trying to save his pride
He was the victim of a love and run
And I could plainly see that she had almost killed him
Left the scene of a broken heart not looking back at what she'd done
Oh, this boy has been hurt, I'll save him
I'll take his heart and mend it if I can
Oh, this boy has been hurt, I'll save him
I'll take his tears and dry them as fast as he can cry them
I'll heal his hurt and make him as good as new again"
"Joy to the world! the lord is come;
Let earth receive her king;
Let every heart prepare him room,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing.
Joy to the earth! the savior reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods,
Rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.
No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make his blessing flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as the curse is found.
He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousness,
And wonders of his love,
And wonders of his love,
And wonders, wonders of his love."
"Fighting soldiers from the sky
Fearless men who jump and die
Men who mean just what they say
The brave men of the Green Beret
1st Chorus:
Silver wings upon their chest
These are men, America's best
One hundred men we'll test today
But only three win the Green Beret
Trained to live, off nature's land
Trained in combat, hand to hand
Men who fight by night and day
Courage deep from the Green Beret
Repeat 1st Chorus
Delta Force and CIA
Marines and SOCOM clear the way
Covert missions now in play
Special OPS like the Green Beret
Repeat 1st Chorus
While back at home a young wife waits
Her Green Beret has met his fate
He has died for those oppressed
Leaving her this last request
2nd Chorus:
Put silver wings on my son's chest
Make him one of America's best
He'll be a man they'll test one day
So have him win the Green Beret
Have him win the Green Beret
Repeat 1st Chorus"
"I don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you've promised
Beneath the halo moon
But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrows
While you play your cheatin' game
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind
You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind
You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine"
"There is a house down in New Orleans
Down in the Vieux Carr'e
A house they call the rising sun
Where love and money are made
My father he was a gambler
Mother died when I was young
And I've worked since then
To please the men
At the house of the rising sun
There is a house
Down in New Orleans
They call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh God, you know I'm one
So mothers you go telling all your daughters
Not to do what I've done
To live a life of sin, shame and strife
In the house of the rising sun"
"Folks say my daddy wasn't much of a man
For disobeying the laws of the land
Folks say that my daddy wasn't fit to kill
Oh and I know it was true what the people said
Cause we'd all've been better of dead
Than to live a life of shame and strife
Cause of daddy's moonshine still
My mama was always sweet and kind
But she grew old before her time
Worryin' about the way we had to live
Yeah my daddy put the wrinkles in my mama's face
He drunk his share of all he made
And just one more reason I grew to hate
My daddy's moonshine still
Chorus:
Daddy's moonshine still was good for nothin'
But to break mama's heart
And to tear our home apart
Make our lives a livin' hell
Them old mason jars that daddy made us wash
And set them out to sun on our back porch
'Til he got ready to take 'em up on the hill
And when daddy got word of the revenue
He made us kids help hide his brew
Made us swear that we never knew
About daddy's moonshine still
Yeah and two of my brothers drove across the state line
Once a week with a load of moonshine
And the wounds that came from that won't ever heal
Cause on a moonshine run one rainy night
My two brothers lost their lives
And oh my god how I despise
My daddy's moonshine still
Repeat Chorus
Well it broke mama's heart but she understood
The day that I left home for good
But I had to find me another way to live
Well I sent mama money nearly every day
And how I made it, well I'd rather not say
But at least it took me far away
From daddy's moonshine still
My bootlegging daddy was known quite well
And he made our home a livin' hell
And I ain't forgot it and I know that I never will
My mama finally died she just gave up
And daddy finally died from drinkin' that stuff
And bad memories haunt the rest of us
From daddy's moonshine still
Repeat Chorus"
"Lord take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark
Too dark to see
I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door
Chorus:
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Lord takes these guns away from me
Cause I can't shoot them anymore
A long black cloud is followin' me
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's
Repeat Chorus
Ooo ooo ooo Heaven Heaven
Ooo ooo ooo Heaven Heaven
Ooo ooo ooo Heaven Heaven
Ooo ooo ooo Heaven Heaven
Lord take this badge off of me

Spent all my money on everyone else
Why I just kept handing it out right and left
They didn't appreciate none of my help
I have found
Had me a man
I was so much in love
But he just walked off after using me up
I cried like a baby
It hurt me so much and I'm down
Yeah, I'm sure down
I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up
I just need some time
Just need a little streak of good luck
And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am
You try to do right but tell me where does that get you
People just use you and then they forget you
Well it wont take me long
To get my feet back on solid ground
But now I'm down
When I get my life back in order again
Well I'll still be willing to help out my friends
And if you need some body or wished it had been, look around
I'll be spending my money on everyone else
Well I'll just be handing it out right and left
I'll find a new love i wont live by myself
I'm just down, now, yeah I'm down
I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up
I just need some time
Just need a little streak of good luck
And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am
You try to do right but tell me where does that get you
People just use you and then they forget you
Well it wont take me long
To get my feet back on solid ground
But now I'm down
I know that I'm down
But I'm bound to get up"
"(Dolly Parton)
He is high and mighty
He is high and mighty
He is there and ever waiting
Reaching out to you and me
He is high and mighty
Oh, mighty is His power
Mighty is His love
He is high and mighty
He is there with the answers
Let us lift Him up
God loves you, did you know that?
Ain't it good to know he cares
If you're burdened down with troubles
Just go to Him in prayer
Say God, I'm just a seeker
I'm empty, scared and lost
Then lay your burdens down
At the foot of the cross
He said ye shall know the truth
And the truth shall set you free
He will guide and lead you
And fulfill every need
Nothing is impossible
If you have faith enough
So if you've lost direction
Stop and just look up
'Cause He is high and mighty
Ooh, mighty is His power, mighty is His love
He is high and mighty
He is life everlasting
Let us lift Him up
High and mighty
He is high and mighty
I believe, I do believe
That His love has set me free
I believe, I believe, I believe
He is high and mighty
Oh, mighty is His power, mighty is His love
He is high and He's mighty
It's a wonderful feeling
Let us lift Him up
He said if I be lifted up
He said if I be lifted up
What did He say?
He said if I be lifted up
I'll draw all the men unto me
Let's lift him higher, higher
Higher and higher each day
Let's lift Him up
'Cause He is high and He's mighty
And He has washed my sins away
'Cause He's high and He's mighty"
"So often in my dreams
I hold you close against my skin
Waking up I wish that I could
Sleep and dream again
Cause only when I sleep
Can I not hear how it's a sin
How cheaters never win
Their heartaches never end
""Torn Between Two Lovers"" on the jukebox
And I'm thinking how I could've wrote that song
Wonderin' if God loves us, when we're cheatin'
But why he lets us feels things if it's wrong
I guess I should be singing ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"", some of those good songs
Can't find it in my heart to ask forgiveness
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
Thou shalt not commit it
It's written in the tin
The spirit is always willing
But the flesh is weak again
And you're as close to heaven
As I might ever fly
An angel in disguise
A wrong that feels so right
And Torn Between Two Lovers just keeps playing
And I don't wanna be right if lovin' you is wrong
It goes against all I've ever stood for
Knowin' I have someone else at home
I guess I should be singing ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"", some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart can tell on me tomorrow
Cause anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
To hell with heaven if it means I'll lose you
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
It just can't be"
"Hmm (oh ain't he cute)
Ah well I don't like to get up if I feel like sleeping
No and I don't like to sweep my floor if I don't feel like sweeping
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
I've been this way too long and you can't ever change me now
Don't waste your time in tryin' cause I am just what I am
I've got my way of doin' things and who can say I'm wrong
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
Oh and I don't like to make my bed if I don't feel like makin' it
No and I don't like to bake no bread if I don't feel like bakin' it
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
Cause you can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
Well I don't like to hoe no corn if I don't feel like hoein' it
(You should you're corny)
And I don't like to mow no grass if I don't feel like mowin' it
(I know it's comin' through the upstairs window)
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
If you don't like the way I am...
Oh as far as I can remember back you have been this way
(And as long as you remember I will be honey)
When you was in the first grade you was exact the same way
(First grade I was waitin' for the second)
You swiped the pencils and scattered paper all over the desk
(Oh that's real cute you're makin' up stuff)"
"The bridge so high the bridge so tall here is where it's started on bridge
The moon is big and yellow and the stars're all aglow
From the bridge I see reflection in the waters far below
You kissed me for the first time here held me awfully tight
And the bridge became our favorite place we came here often in the night
One night while standing on the bridge desire swept through a spoke
Passion took us by the hand and showed us where to go
From the bridge we saw a meadow so we ran together there
Where we found love together hurry motions filled the air
The bridge so wide the bridge so long
Where once we stood together tonight I stand alone
Tonight while standing on the bridge my heart is beating wild
To think that you could leave me here with our unborn child
My feet are moving slowly closer to the edge
Here is where it's started and here is where I'll end it"
"New York City ain't no kind of place
For a country girl with a friendly face
If you smile people look at you funny, they take it wrong
The greenest state in the land of the free
And the home of the Grand Ole Opry
Is calling me back to my Smoky Mountain home
I wish I had my old fishin' pole
And was sitting on the banks of the fishing hole
Eating green apples and waiting for the fish to bite
Life ain't as simple as it used to be
Just since the big apple took a bite out of me
And Lord, I'm so Tennessee homesick that I could die
But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
What I wouldn't give for a little bitty taste
Of Mama's homemade chocolate cake
Tennessee homesick blues is running through my head
Mama you can fluff my feather bed
Just as soon as I can I'm gonna head
Back to the Tennessee hills and it better be soon
Daddy you can load the rifles up
We're gonna load them dogs on the pickup truck
And head up to Calhoun Country and catch us a coon
But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
Eatin' grits and gravy and country ham
Go to church on Sunday with dinner on the grounds
Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head
And I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
Good Lord, have mercy on a country girl
Tryin' to make a living in a rhinestone world
It's hard to be a diamond in a rhinestone world
With Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head
I've got those Tennessee homesick blues runnin' through my head
Tennessee homesick blues"
"Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and see"
"They say a woman's a fool for weeping
A fool to break her own heart
But I can't hold the secret I'm keeping
I'm breaking apart
Can't seem to mind my own business
Whatever I try turns out wrong
I seem like my own false witness
And I can't go on
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies
You told me you needed my company
And I believed in your flattering ways
You told me you needed me forever
Nearly gave you the rest of my days
Should've seen you for what you are
Should never have come back for more
Should've locked up all my silver
Brought the key right to your door
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies
You don't know what a chance is
Until you have to seize one
You don't know what a man is
Until you have to please one
Don't put your life in the hands of a man
With a face for every season
Don't waste your time in the arms of a man
Who's no stranger to treason
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies"
"Silent night holy night all is calm all is bright
Round young virgin mother and child holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar heavenly hosts sing hallelujah
Christ the Savior is born Christ the Savior is born
Silent night holy night son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face with the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at Thy birth Jesus Lord at Thy birth"
"(Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner)
Oh, the pain of loving you
Oh, the misery I go through
Never knowing what to do
Oh, the pain of loving you
You just can't stand to see me happy
Seems you hurt me all you can
Still I go on loving you
But I never understand
To love and hate at the same time
The line between the two is fine
The two have bound me heart and soul
So strong that I can't let you go"
"(Dolly Parton/Bill Owens)
She married the one I love today
When my back was turned she took him away
Now while they're all outside, waiting to throw rice
What I want to throw will surely black her eyes
'Cause I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad
Well I never stole nothin' in my life
But if I get the chance I'll steal him from his wife
'Cause all is fair in love and war, maybe I'm carryin' this too far
But I feel like tying dynamite to her side of the car"
"Letra de Miss You, Miss Me -
""Miss You, Miss Me""
Miss me,
Don't you miss someone to hold you, now in the end?
And kiss me
And tell me I'm your lil' girl again
Daddy, when you left, did you remove yourself
From every sweet remembrance of me?
I'm always missing you, I hope you miss me too
And everything we were and still could be
Miss little things like walking in the park
Miss summer nights with fireflies in the jar
Big memories of you playing your guitar
Miss all of this, it's true, but mostly I miss you
'Cause no one else could ever take your place
And momma, don't you miss that home is all about
And all the drama caused by the anger you keep acting out?
Why can't you both just see, you didn't divorce me?
Forgive, forget and try to get along
I miss us being close, I love and miss you both
Don't miss the plea I've written in my song
Your little miss is missing out on you
And you're both missing out on so much too
Put pride aside and do what you should do
Don't make me have to choose,
'Cause I love the both of you
Just let resentment go, and think of me
You've torn my world apart, and it breaks my little heart
Can't you see me? And see me missing you?
Oooh, I miss you, I miss you, miss me!
Miss me! I miss you. Miss me!"
"Look how the wind carries the seed
See how the soil supplies what it needs
The rain falls, the sun shines and a flower breaks free
And it all works together, why can't we
And I have seen children at play in the park
Skin shades of ivory, red, yellow and dark
Well, my eyes saw colors their little hearts could not see
They were playing together, why can't we
Why can't we, why can't we
I can love you and you can love me
Why can't we, why can't we
Set our foolish pride free, just be and let be
Why can't we
I had a dream about a lion and a lamb
They were playing together and there was peace in the land
And swords became plowshares 'cause there were no enemies
And I woke up and wondered, God why can't we
Why can't we, why can't we
I can love you and you can love me
Why can't we, why can't we
Set our foolish pride free, just be and let be
Why can't we
Set our foolish pride free, just be and let be
Why can't we, m-m-m-m
Why can't we"

Last night as I lay on the boxcar
Just waiting for a train to pass by
What will become of the hobo
Whenever his time comes to die
There's a Master up yonder in heaven
Got a place that we might call our home
Will we have to work for a living
Or can we continue to roam
Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride
Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there
Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there be any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride
Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies hidden up there"
"Now I've been happy lately
Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun
Oh, I've been smiling lately
Dreaming about the world as one
And I believe it could be
Someday it's going to come
'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Peace train take this country
Come take me home again
Now I've been smiling lately
Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun
[Chorus]
Peace train sounding louder
Ride on the peace train
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah
Come on peace train
Peace train holy roller
Everyone jump on the peace train
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah
Come on peace train
Get your bags together
Go bring all your good friends, too
'cause it's getting nearer
Soon it will be with you
Now come and join the living
It's not so far from you
And it's getting nearer
Soon it will all be true
[Chorus]
Now I've been crying lately
Thinking about the world as it is
Why must we go on hating
Why can't we live in bliss
'cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Where peace train take this country
Come take me home again
[Chorus]
Peace train is sounding louder
Ride on the peace train
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah
Come on peace train
Peace train holy roller
Jump up on the peace train
Ride - ride on the peace train"
"There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road
I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild
Sometimes there is a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Runnin' like a child from these warm stars
Down the seven bridges road
There are stars in the southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time sweet as honey
Down the seven bridges road
There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road
Down the seven bridges road"
"(Dolly Parton)
If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really not
My kind of man
I don't believe you have the right
To ask me to be different
Either take me like I am
Or let me be
If you really love me
I mean, really loved or love me
You wouldn't want to change
One part of me
If you can't be satisfied with me
The way I am
If I can't make you happy
Find someone who can
If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really
Not my kind of man
I couldn't make you happy
If I let you change me
For I know you wouldn't love me
That-a way
I can only be myself
But if you want something else
Then I can see no reason
I should stay
If you can't be satisfied with me
The way I am
If I can't make you happy
Find someone who can
If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really
Not my kind of man
If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really
Not my kind of man"
"All your love lifting me higher
Than I ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
Then I'll be at your side forevermore
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
Now once I was downhearted
This little loneliness my foes and friend
But when you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
I'm so glad I finally found you
Yes that one in a million girl
And now with my loving arms around you
I can stand up and face the world
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher"
"Just a few old memories
Slipped in through my door
Though I thought I had closed it
So tightly before
I can't understand it
Why it should bother my mind
For it all belongs to another place and time
Just a few old keep-sakes
Way back on the shelf
No, they don't mean nothin'
Well I'm surprised they're still left
Just a few old love letters
With the edges all brown
And an old faded picture
I keep turned upside-down
Just a few old memories
Going way back in time
Well I can hardly remember
I don't know why I'm cryin'
I can't understand it
Well I'm surprised myself
First thing tomorrow morning
I'll clean off that shelf
Just a few old keep-sakes
Way back on the shelf
No, they don't mean nothin'
Well I'm surprised that they're left
Just a few old love letters
With their edges all brown
And an old faded picture
I keep turned upside-down"

Bobby's arms, they are warm when he holds me
Bobby's arms always comfort and console me
When I'm in his arms held tight
I know everything's alright
Just as long as I'm inside bobby's arms
Chorus:
Bobby's arms always welcome me inside
Bobby's arms always hold me when I cry
Bobby's arms are my shelter from life's storms
And I feel so safe in Bobby's arms
Bobby's arms, they are strong but they're tender
Bobby's arms reach for me and I surrender
When he reaches out for me, I'm never out of reach
And I always want to be in Bobby's arms"
"As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto
People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto
As her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto"
"(Dolly Parton)
Let me walk in the sunshine of your smile
Let me hide in the shadows of your eyes
Let me lie in the safety of your arms
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
I'll keep you warm
Let me be the someone that you need
Let me be the shelter that you seek
Let me be your strength when you are weak
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
Let me walk in the sunshine of your smile
Let me hide in the shadows of your eyes
Let me lie in the safety of your arms
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
I'll keep you warm
Let me be the one always around
Let me help you up when you are down
Let me make a smile out of a frown
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
Let me walk in the sunshine of your smile
Let me hide in the shadows of your eyes
Let me lie in the safety of your arms
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
I'll keep you warm
Let me be the fire that keeps you warm"

"You were not content with me when I was like I used to be
I was too old-fashioned, too simple and too plain
And so you took this country girl, taught me all about the world
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
I used to never drink or smoke, I'd even blush at dirty jokes
I never wanted to take part in all those worldly games
But you dressed me up in sexy clothes, took me where the swingers go
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
But you don't want me swingin' now, but you're the one that taught me how
It was you that wanted me to change
I'm only what you made of me, your mistake was changin' me
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
You want me like I was before but I'm not like that anymore
This plain, old, simple, country girl won't ever be the same
So don't expect me to go back 'cause it's a bit too late for that
And you're the one that taught me how to swing"
"Waiting for the train to come
I keep a'waiting for the train to come
Dreamin' of the river and the rising sun
I keep thinkin' 'bout the world to come
My life packed up in a suitcase
Old man staring from a doorway
My hope tarries in the distance
Love comes on the wheels of my deliverance
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Waitin' for the train to come
I keep waitin' for the train to come
Keepin' my appointment with the one who lives
In the heart of everything that is
All night sleepin' in a station
My God, it's hard not to be impatient
I watch through the windows of forgiveness
I cry but my word's my only witness
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Sometimes I feel I can't go on, I can't go on
I get so tired, all passion's gone
My heart, my head, my arms, my legs, I get so tired
Without the strength to crawl away
Then something breaks inside my soul, My strength is gone
That spirit's finally taking hold
My ears can hear, my eyes can see
Those clouds of joy still cover me, cover me, cover me
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is, where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow

The snow was fallin' swiftly and it mounted on the street
Little footprints in the snow made by our children's feet
As I walked them to the good will store to get some clothes to wear
As we turned around the corner I saw you standing there
I tried to turn the children and walk the other way
I prayed they hadn't seen you then I heard the baby say
""Mommie, ain't that Daddy holding out his hand
Begging for money from that other man?""
They asked me ""Ain't that Daddy?""
And ""Yes"" I had to say
And I wondered if I'd failed you
And made you turn this way
No, you didn't fail me, my weakness was just too strong
Because you see, I thought more of the bottle than our family and our home
No, you didn't fail me sweetheart, you loved me all you could
You had my babies and you loved me like no other woman ever would
You know I guess I'd be better off dead
Than in the awful shape I'm in
But death just don't seem to have a place for those that stay drunk on whiskey, wine and gin
You see I die a constant death over and over every day
If I could change, you know I'd do it for you, the babies and our home
But you might as well forget me for I'm just too forward gone
But I wish you would do me one last favor and do it just for me
When they ask you, ""Momma ain't that Daddy?""
Just say ""It used to be"""
"(Billy Joel)
Hey Lord, take a look on around tonight
And find out where my baby's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For he is far away from me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
Make sure that he's gonna be alright
Things gonna be alright with me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
And make sure all his dreams are sweet
Send down that ya got him on the road
But you'll make it softer for his feet
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
Make sure that he's gonna be alright
'Til he's home and here with me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For he is sleeping under the sky
Hey Lord, make sure the ground he's sleepin' on
Is always warm and dry
Ooo, don't give him too much pain
And keep him away from planes
Cause my baby hates to fly
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For it gets rough along the way
And if it all sounds strange
Just because I don't know how to pray
Ooo, won't you give him peace of mind
And if you ever find the time
Tell him I miss him everyday
Hey Lord, take a look on around tonight
And find out where he's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For he is far away from me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
Make sure that he's gonna be alright
'Til he's home and here with me
Here with me"
"Familiar sounds tell me it's morning the night has been so dark and long
Each night without you just gets longer
While this torch I still carry just burns stronger
I know I never will stop loving you my tears just can't put out the flame
Or drown my hopes of your returning cause baby the fire's still burning
[ steel ]
Wherever you are I hope you're happy although your love for me has died
But if you ever need or want me I'll take you back any time
I know I never will stop...
Yes baby the fire's still burning"

Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll fly away to you, if only pretending
We'll be like bluebirds do, the beautiful lie
The beautiful lie, the beautiful lie
Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll find my way to you, if I'm only pretending
And we'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie
We'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie"
"I can see it on your face
It's over it's all over it's all over me and you
Love came down like the rains from heaven
Love's all over us dripping like the morning dew
We can't hide it anymore you can't hide real love
When it's all over all over me and you
And it's wonderful to know it's all over
Love sweet love it's all over me and you
Once we worried what folks would think if they only knew
Just how much love there was between me and you
Oh but it's no secret anymore it's all out in plain view
And love's all over us love's all over me and you
We can't hide it anymore..."

They say the love we steal is a disgrace
That we should be ashamed to look the world in the face
But they don't know how much love we must hide
While the world looks down upon our pride
Seems there's always someone looking down down down
Not knowing inner feelings of the ones they're puttin' down
(The love we feel's as true as a baby's crying sound)
Still there's always someone looking down
We still honor the vows we made long ago
But when there's no love at home it hurts us so
And then your heart begins to look around
Love found us now the world's a looking down
Seems there's always someone...
The love we must keep silent hurts us now but love will always find a way
somehow
Till then the world will look at us and frown
But we'll love each other while they're looking down
Seems there's always someone...
Seems there's always someone looking down"
sometimes we feel the power of gods great hands are failed by some not worthy while those who sing and praise god's name seem to be passed by but worthy or not god loves us all or even a little bird that couldn't fly why is life given and taken away to soon for some to tell and others live for many years and walk a path to hell a cripple at birth may speak gods name and tender tongues with pain while a man with hell ends well or take gods name in vein but gods reasons may not be known or questioned by me and you like the little bird i saw like the bird that never flew i feel close to each name god made the earth the sky the sea and each creature living here belongs to him even you and me and one day when i was walking along i saw some of gods beautiful things by the path by which i walked i saw a small bird that had no wings so i sat down and held out my hand and that little bird climbed on and i held him for a long long time i thought that maybe his mom might come and he looked at me and thought he might of found him a friend for a bird that never flew so i built him a house on the ground like a few birds i've ever know and he seemed to be so happy there with some friends he knew and his new home and for two years i watched and fed him as with the other birds he played but when they got tired they just flew away then i looked at the loneliness in his eyes and watched the birds fly into the blue but then i look at understandience though he knew why he couldn't do that to and then one summary evening at sunset i saw a perfect picture of love each one of his playmates where beautiful white doves then the ruffle of their feathers as they started into flight but then i noticed all but one dove was fine but he looked like my bird but he had wings solid gold and new but then i knew it was my bird the little bird that never flew until then
"Without you
The days come and go they mean nothing to me
Nothing means nothing without you
My eyes overflow till all I can see
Is a future I can't face without you
Without you without you it's not like before
How can I face life without you
The days are as dark as the nights anymore
And I am so lonely without you without you
Too many things to remind me of you
How could I forget about you
Oh how can I make it now that I've lost you
For I am so lost without you
Without you without you it's not like before..."
"You're the sweetest one I know and I just can't let you go
I just dream of holding you inside my arms
I go home each night to stay but I just can't stay away
And we get closer closer by the hour
We get closer by the hour though we've tried with all our power
To stay away from each other's arms
We get closer by the hour like the bee goes to the flower
Closer closer by the hour
We come closer with each kiss and I feel your lips insist
But I do your will and love you more and more
Although we know it's wrong we can't stay where we belong
And we get closer closer by the hour
We get closer by the hour..."
"I became a woman of the world cause I was fed up with the farm
And I thought pretty clothes and city lights
Running round both day and night could do no harm
A party girl I mixed for bout myself into a fix for running wild
So I wrote my dad and mom asked if I could come back home to have my child
I received the letter from the folks back home and they said things were fine
They went on to say that Pete the boy I broke up with was about to lose his mind
But I couldn't hardly read the rest the words were being bloted by my tears
I'm feelin' so ashamed he loved me then he feels the same he still cares
So I'm going home for Pete's sake it was I who broke his heart in the first place
If he'll try me one more time for then I've made up my mind
And in the morning I'm going home for Pete's sake
Yes for Pete's sake my baby's and mine"
"A mother sings as she rocks her babies
Children sing the noted nursery rhymes
The old church bell is ringing for the Sunday morning singing
Music is as old as the time
As the farmer works the fields he sings a song
The songbirds in the trees sing along
And the wind makes melodies as it whistles through the trees
Man's burdens are made lighter with a song
There'll always be music as long as there's a story to be told
There'll always be music cause music is the voice of the soul
There'll always be music
Rain makes rhytmic sounds when it's falling
There's music in a new born baby's cry
There's music all around and there is no sweeter sound
For that's the way a man expresses life
In heaven there's a choir of angels singing
We often heard about God's angel band
Music will live on when men on earth are gone
There'll still be music in that promised land
There'll always be music..."
"The bridge so high the bridge so tall here is where it's started on bridge
The moon is big and yellow and the stars're all aglow
From the bridge I see reflection in the waters far below
You kissed me for the first time here held me awfully tight
And the bridge became our favorite place we came here often in the night
One night while standing on the bridge desire swept through a spoke
Passion took us by the hand and showed us where to go
From the bridge we saw a meadow so we ran together there
Where we found love together hurry motions filled the air
The bridge so wide the bridge so long
Where once we stood together tonight I stand alone
Tonight while standing on the bridge my heart is beating wild
To think that you could leave me here with our unborn child
My feet are moving slowly closer to the edge
Here is where it's started and here is where I'll end it"

Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack 'til the mail comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
I ain't gonna work on the railroad
I ain't gonna work on the farm
Lay down the shack 'til the mail train comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
Now where were you last Friday night
While I was lying in jail
Walking the streets with another man
Wouldn't even go my bail
I know you parents don't like me
They drove me away from your door
If I had my life to live over
I'd never go there any more"
"Sometimes I try to count the ways and reasons that I love you
But I can't ever seem to count that far
I love you in a million ways and for a million reasons
More than this I love you as you are
More than this I love you as you are
You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are
You are my thoughts when I'm awake, my dreams when I'm asleep
You are the reason for my smile, you are the words I speak
Every role I play in life you play the leading part
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything

When your eyes meet mine my heart beats out of time
And I burn with desire through and through
I can't help myself I can't see no one else cause my eyes can only see you
My eyes can only see you my eyes can only see you
Your face is always in view for my eyes can only see you
I want you so much and I long for your touch and your eyes tell me you want me

Oh it may not be right but I'm too weak to fight and my eyes can only see you
My eyes can only see you...

Only second best that's all I will ever be
Even though I'm second best you're still first with me
And I'll be loving you when they fall my hand I guess

"As blue skies and daylight darken into night
Surrounding us with beauty as the stars make their light
They spell out our names all the stars up above
As they flicker and shine like letters of love
Then a warm breath of air whispers through the trees
As the leaves on their branches have blown to the breeze
Ripples of water seemed to echo the sound
Love's out tonight there's love all around
Small drops of dew act as nature's perfume
Placing its fragrance on all that's in blue
While I hold you so close your lips touching mine
With nature all around us watching our love entwine
Love's out tonight see the candles in the sky
God lend us the heavens tonight for you and I
A night full of love for all the world to see
Love's out tonight all around you and me
Love's out tonight"
"I used to love it when roses would come.
The card always read, ""You're my number 1"".
But love never goes the way one supposes,
And I will forever hate roses.
You sent me roses, I thought it was nice.
Opened the card and it read, ""goodbye"".
You're movin' on as this chapter closes,
And I will forever hate roses.
I'll never see a rose from now on
That will not remind me that you're really gone.
Don't trust the rose for the danger it poses
I will forever hate roses.
The fragrance of roses will last throughout time.
Their beauty will linger, but not in my mind.
No, I'll love the daisies, the tulips, the posies,
But I will forever hate roses.
And I'll never see a rose from now own
That will not remind me that you're really gone.
Oh, and don't trust the rose for the pain it imposes.
I will forever hate roses.
Now you're movin' on as this chapter closes,
And I will forever hate roses.
Yes, I will forever hate roses."

Who's gonna tell me the truth?
Who's gonna finish the stories I start,

Someone new walks in

But you can't make old friends
You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
It was me and you, since way back when
But you can't make old friends
How will I sing when you are gone?
'Cause it won't sound the same
Who'll join in on those harmony parts,
When I call your name?
You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
It was you and me, since way back when
You can't make old friends
When Saint Peter opens the gate,
And you come walking in
I'll be there just waiting for you

'Cause you can't make old friends, no no

And I hear the music begin
We all know the show must go on
But you can't make old friends, no no
You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
And you and me, will be young again
You can't make old friends
You and me, will be together again
'Cause we both know, we will still be old friends
You can't make old friends
Not the way we have always been"
"Now I've been happy lately
Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun
Oh, I've been smiling lately
Dreaming about the world as one
And I believe it could be
Someday it's going to come
'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Peace train take this country
Come take me home again
Now I've been smiling lately
Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun
[Chorus]
Peace train sounding louder
Ride on the peace train
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah
Come on peace train
Peace train holy roller
Everyone jump on the peace train
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah
Come on peace train
Get your bags together
Go bring all your good friends, too
'cause it's getting nearer
Soon it will be with you
Now come and join the living
It's not so far from you
And it's getting nearer
Soon it will all be true
[Chorus]
Now I've been crying lately
Thinking about the world as it is
Why must we go on hating
Why can't we live in bliss
'cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Where peace train take this country
Come take me home again
[Chorus]
Peace train is sounding louder
Ride on the peace train
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah
Come on peace train
Peace train holy roller
Jump up on the peace train
Ride - ride on the peace train"
"You're standing much too close to me again
I'd never once touched you
But in my mind I've already sinned
You're making it hard for me to be true
I don't trust me around you
Seems like every place I go I see you there
I can't keep my eyes off you
I just stand and stare
You tempt me more than anyone I ever knew
I don't trust me around you
I don't trust me around you
I belong to someone else
Not once have I been untrue
But when I'm close to you this way I find myself wanting to
I don't trust me around you"
"(Dolly Parton)
Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear me, are you listenin' any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speakin' terms
Can you help me like before?
I have questioned your existence,
My resistance leaves me cold
Can you help me go the distance?
Hello God, hello, hello
This old world has gone to pieces
Can we fix it, is there time?
Hate and violence just increases
We're so selfish, cruel and blind
We fight and kill each other
In your name, defending you
Do you love some more than others?
We're so lost and confused
Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear us, are you listenin' any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speakin' terms
Can you help us like before?
Oh, the free will you have given
We have made a mockery of
This is no way to be livin',
We're in great need of your love
Hello God
Hello God, can you grant us
Love enough to make amends
(Hello God) Is there still a chance
That we could start again
Hello God, we've learned our lesson
Dear God, don't let us go
More than ever
Hello God, hello, hello
Hello God, we really need you
We can't make it without you
(Hello God) We beseech you
In the name of all that's true
Hello God, please forgive us
For we know not what we do
Hello God, give us one more chance to prove ourselves to you
Hello, God; hello, God"
"(Dolly Parton)
My train of thought was broken by a sudden burst of laughter
Something badly needed to lighten up the chores
Seemed old Mrs. Bailey had accidentally fell
In the water being used to scrub the floors
Now Mrs. Bailey was the meanest matron at the home
She believed in lots of work with little play
And we laughed till we bent double
Though we knew we'd get in trouble
But trouble's all we had at evening shade
Now evening shade was where they claim to teach you understanding
To teach you love and keep you off the streets
And all the kids that live there are said to be a problem
Juvenile delinquents so to speak
But understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger
An iron hand has no gentle touch and love ain't learned from hate
The reason we were there is 'cause we had no one who cared
But they cared even less at evening shade
Little Susan Bradley, one night had wet her bed
Mrs. Bailey took the razor strap and beat her half to death
And I knew that something must be done to put an end to this
And so I started talking plans with the older kids
Plans were that Joe Johnson would steal the kerosene
And I would get some matches when nobody seen
Beckie Adams would make sure the kids were all outside
Billy Watson would look out for the evil eye
Now Mrs. Bailey took a nap at three o'clock each day
We knew that she'd be a'sleeping as the plans got underway
Now that its all over and the sun is going down
There's no evening shade because we burned it to the ground
Evening Shade was burning just like the hell it was"
"(Dolly Parton)
Thumbing for a ride by the edge of the road
With a brown paper bag to hold my clothes
But tonight I'm going home where I belong
If the good lord's willing and the creek don't rise
And if my luck holds out, and I catch me a ride
When the sun goes down tomorrow, I should be home
This big city ain't no kind of place
For a country girl with a friendly face
If you smile people look at your funny, they take it wrong
They laugh at my talkin' and clothes I wear
They put me down and they call me square
But tonight I'm going home where I belong
I'm goin' back to the people I love
Back to the place that I dream of
It's true that there's no place like home sweet home
The one I want to see the most
Is the boy who begged me not to go
When the sun goes down tomorrow
Tonight I'm going back where I belong"
"(Dolly Parton)
You say that you're bored with life and that you're bored with me
'Cause you say that this love of ours ain't what it ought to be
Now you despise this little house that we've always called home
I know that you don't love me now, but you'll love me when I'm gone
Gone
You'll love me when I'm gone and then you'll realize just what I meant to you
You-oo-oo-oo
You'll miss me when I'm gone and then you'll realize how good I've been to you
You-ooo-ooo-ooo
You'll want me when I'm gone and then you'll realize you've loved me all along
Oh, it's true you may not love me now, but you'll love me when I'm gone
Gone
We've grown too familiar with each other, so you say
You say there's no excitement now. Too bad you feel that way
Well, I wonder how exciting that your life will be alone
Oh, I know you may not want me now, but you'll miss me when I'm gone
Gone
You'll love me when I'm gone and then you'll realize just what I meant to you
You-oo-oo-oo
You'll miss me when I'm gone and then you'll realize how good I've been to you
You-ooo-ooo-ooo
You'll want me when I'm gone and then you'll realize you've loved me all along
Oh, I know you may not want me now, but you'll miss me when I'm gone
Gone"
"We three kings of Orient are bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain moor and mountain following yonder star
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain gold I bring to crown him again
King forever ceasing never over us all to reign
Star of wonder star of night star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding guide us to Thy perfect light
Frankincense and moor have I my gift of love and sacrifice
Pray'r and praising all men raising worship in God most high
Oh star of wonder star of night..."
"Last Saturday night I looked like a princess dressed in calico
Now blue Monday washday I look like a lady hobo
Just rubbin' and a scrubbin' and a raisin' 'em out
I gotta hang 'em out early I hope the sun comes out
(Wash 'em out ring 'em out hang 'em on the line
Get a little tired just think about the good times) washday blues
Now I ain't never been very lucky I ain't never won a prize
But I'd like to get a job on TV for some of that soap they advertise
Rubbin' and scrubbin...
Well that good lookin' good lovin' no good man of mine
Could buy me a washin' machine
But he spends all his money on payday to make me look like a queen
Now rubbin' and scrubbin'..."
"A corporation owns the factory I work in
Someone else owns the house we call our home
The bank owns the car we drive around
And we've got something we can call our own
We've got love happiness surrounds us
And we thank the Lord for every single day
And with love we'll always have each other
And together we can laugh the years away
[ steel ]
We're so thankful for our lovely children
And I work hard to keep new shoes upon their feet
But sometimes they've not too much on our table
But we've got something that's mighty hard to feed
We've got love happiness surrounds us...
We've got love happiness surrounds us..."
"Love it's not I who didn't try
Hard enough, hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough
Love you don't see
The pain in me
That's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cried for us, I cried for us
I'll take my share but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff
Easy enough
And if you choose I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough
I've tried and tried to put aside
The time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked"
"(B. Tosti/R. O'Hearn)
He takes the train into the city
To him it's more than just a working day
Cause he knows he can change the world in his ordinary way
She's got a job, she has a family
She tries to keep them both together
She's barely getting by, saving everything she makes
Day by day it seems it's getting harder to win
How much longer, ready for their ship to come in
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the working man
Trying to survive, staying alive, giving it all that he can
With a fire in his soul that keeps burning
And a dream in her heart that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life
They started out as high school sweethearts
He promised her a life of luxury
And though they don't have riches they have everything they need
The eyes of her child are her diamonds
The gift of his love are her pearls
Together they plan, taking a stand to make this a better world
But never breaking, knowing that their dreams will begin
Getting stronger in each other's arms
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the modern world
There's a spirit inside that keeps us alive, giving it all that we can
With a fire in our soul that keeps burning
And a dream in our hearts that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life
Everybody has a special reason
There's a chosen road to follow
Just remember nothing good comes easy
Don't surrender till you you find your rainbow
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the working man
Trying to survive, staying alive, giving it all that he can
With a fire in his soul that keeps burning
And a dream in her heart that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life
These are the times of the everyday hero
This is the battlefield of the modern world
There's a spirit inside that keeps us alive, giving it all that we can
With a fire in our soul that keeps burning
And a dream in our hearts that won't die
Living day to day, there's no easy way in this everyday life"
"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord,
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee"

They say most anything you eat could hurt your health
Be careful what you drink, don't harm yourself
And pollution in the air might make you sick
Makes you afraid to live, afraid that you might die too quick
Do the men that quote this danger really know
Life is gift to be enjoyed and not to worry so
The biggest danger sign that we should know
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go
We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'
And afraid to love the one we love, afraid they might be lyin'
We can't enjoy life when they say each thing might bring an early grave
We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'
Do the men that quote this danger really know?
Life is gift to be enjoyed, why worry so?
The biggest danger sign that we should know
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go"
"Familiar sounds tell me it's morning the night has been so dark and long
Each night without you just gets longer
While this torch I still carry just burns stronger
I know I never will stop loving you my tears just can't put out the flame
Or drown my hopes of your returning cause baby the fire's still burning
[ steel ]
Wherever you are I hope you're happy although your love for me has died
But if you ever need or want me I'll take you back any time
I know I never will stop...
Yes baby the fire's still burning"
"That year the spring was six months long and love
Could do no wrong for love to open up the answers
The sun was stapled to the sky a junior prom July
And we at center stage where the dancers.
I knew you when the air was cold I'm there again
My dress was blue and it lay across the chair
Cause I love you I knew you well your heart
Could melt like caramel your eyes was deep like
The sun muddy stream where that tadpole stream
Child begin child you sleep
That year the fog would climb the beach and wrapped
Us out in preach from search lights that the sky
Would sending
I knew you first, I knew you best, I knew from the rest,
I knew you when the spring was ending
As time takes hold you maybe we're growing old
But in my pray I will you see to remain the time
Is sure of now and then it's only me"
"I went into his prison cell
To write his story, if he'd tell
He spoke as tears, fell from his eyes
And he told me when, and how and why
And he said
I asked my love to take a walk
Just to walk, a little ways
And as we walked, then we could talk
About our future wedding day
But when she said, she could never be mine
Well I held a knife against her breast
As into my arms she pressed
She cried ""my love, don't you murder me
'Cause I'm not prepared for eternity""
Then only say that you'll be mine
And in no others' arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
I started home twixt twelve and one
I cried, ""My God, what have I done?""
I've killed the one I love tonight
Because she would not be my bride
Well only say that you'll be mine
And in no others' arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
Down by the banks of the Ohio
Save my soul Lord
Save my soul
There beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio"
"Let's live for tonight dear it's better that way tomorrow we might be apart
Let's live for tonight dear let love let its way
For tomorrow we could have two broken hearts
Lets cast all our worries and heartaches inside forget what the future might hold
Let's live for tonight dear in a world all our own
For tomorrow we may have to be alone
Let's live for tonight dear and try to pretend that we will never be alone
No matter what happened this night will be ours
What tomorrow brings nobody ever knows
For tomorrow we may have to be alone"
"(Dolly Parton)
If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really not
My kind of man
I don't believe you have the right
To ask me to be different
Either take me like I am
Or let me be
If you really love me
I mean, really loved or love me
You wouldn't want to change
One part of me
If you can't be satisfied with me
The way I am
If I can't make you happy
Find someone who can
If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really
Not my kind of man
I couldn't make you happy
If I let you change me
For I know you wouldn't love me
That-a way
I can only be myself
But if you want something else
Then I can see no reason
I should stay
If you can't be satisfied with me
The way I am
If I can't make you happy
Find someone who can
If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really
Not my kind of man
If I'm not your kind of woman
Being just the way I am
Then I know you're really
Not my kind of man"

Glory to His name, oh, holy, holy
There's a city where the streets are paved in gold
A land where the milk and the honey flow
And a mansion which for me
'Cause my bible tells the story
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
Green meadows where the little children play
No sorrow there, just one long happy day
And none will litter there except the pure and the holy
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
And when I've reached my journey's end
And if I'm worthy to go in
Golden streets of glory, I walk on
And the golden streets of my new home
Will lead me up to the master's throne
With the angel band I'll sing
Glory to His name, oh, holy, holy
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
Hallelujah, I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
And when I've reached my journey's end
And if I'm worthy to go in
Golden streets of glory, I'll walk on
And the golden streets of my new home
Will lead me up to the master's throne
With the angel band I'll sing
Glory to His name, oh, holy, holy
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
Hallelujah, I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory"
"Oh dear I'm so tired and so lonesome
I wonder why mommy don't come
She told me to shut up my blue eyes
And before I woke up she'd be home
She said she was going to see Grandma
Who lives by the river so wide
And I guess my mommy's feeling bad
And perhaps she won't be home tonight
So I guess I'll go down and meet daddy
Perhaps he has stopped at the store
It's a great big store full of bottles
And I wish he wouldn't go there anymore
So out in the night with the baby
Her little heart beating with pride
'Til her tired feet entered the gin palace
With music all radiant with light
Oh daddy she cried as she reached him
I think that the music's so sweet
But it's almost suppertime daddy
Little blossom wants something to eat
A moment his blurred eyes gazed wildly
Down into her face sweet and fair
And as the demon possessed him
He grasped at the back of a chair
A moment a second was over
He lifted her fair golden head
A moment the baby's left trembled
Then poor little blossom was dead"
"To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven
A time to be born, a time to die
A time to plant, a time to reap
A time to kill, a time to heal
A time to laugh, a time to weep
To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven
A time to build up, a time to break down
A time to dance, a time to mourn
A time to cast away stones
A time to gather stones together
To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven
A time of love, a time of hate
A time of war, a time of peace
A time you may embrace
A time to refrain from embracings
A time to gain, a time to lose
A time to rend, a time to sew
A time to love, a time to hate
A time of peace, I swear it's not too late"
"There's no love left our love's beyond help
Why do we keep on tryin' when there's no love left
The feeling we felt for each other
For a long time now has been dying
We'd both be better off without each other
We can't bring it back to life why do we keep trying
There's no love left...
[ steel - fiddle ]
When love is gone it's gone and you can't bring it back
When the warm sun goes down it turns cold
We both might as well just accept the fact
There's nothing warm left for us to hold
There's no love left...
There's no love left..."
"On a park bench on sunny afternoon
Sat a young boy and a girl bout seventeen
As we stood so closely by watched them hold each other's hand
On their faces love had written we're making plans
Then he said to her you're my guiding light
Then she said to him you make my whole world seem so bright
Then we saw their books of braille and that neither one could see
Then I thought how close they must be
Souch tenderness my eyes have never seen
Two young lovers both just in their teens
Though their world gives them no light they see much more than you and me
Don't you know how close they must be
Then a car stopped just a few steps away
And a voice said Jim and Jeannie it's time to go
With their hands still clutched so tight helping each other to the car
Can you imagine just how close they are
Don't you know how close they must be"
"(Dolly Parton)
The hardest thing I've done or that I'll ever do
Was to just walk off and leave you
But I knew I had to leave you
'Cause I couldn't stay and watch you
Falling out of love with me
The worst pain that I've ever known
Or that I'll ever know
Was to see your love-a-dying
And to have to watch it dying
And I couldn't stand to watch you
Falling out of love with me
I'm hurting now, but still it's better
I left while love was still alive
It was dying and I'd rather
I didn't have to watch it die
The loneliest I've ever been
Or that I'll ever be
Now that I'm without you
But I couldn't stand to watch you
Falling out of love with me"

Yes I see God where the mountains reach the sky
And I see God when the eagle starts to fly
I see God in a little baby's smile I see God and he makes my life worthwhile
Yes I see God when the bridegroom meets his bride
I see God in a father's loving eyes
I see God when a mother starts to cry I see God in a love that never dies
(I see God) where the people meet to pray (I see God) in the things they do and
say
(I see God) when the little children play
I see God and I know he's near all way
I see God yes I see God"

There is a place where the sun's always glowing
Take me there, won't you take me there
Meadows grow green near the streams gently flowing
Take me there, won't you take me there
A city of riches beyond comprehension
Take me there, won't you take me there
Streets are of gold, gates of pearl, brilliant mansions
Take me there, won't you take me there
Take me and show me this rare place you speak of
Take me there, won't you take me there
To this land of plenty where there is complete love
Take me there, won't you take me there
At the foot of the throne the kingdom rejoices
Take me there, won't you take me there
The angels are singing His praise with their voices
Hallelujah, hallelujah take me there
Peace, joy and love linger on through the ages
Take me there, won't you take me there
Lambs lay with lions and lions with babies
Take me there, won't you take me there
Take me and show me this rare place you speak of
Take me there, won't you take me there
To this land of plenty where there is complete love
Take me there, I can't take you there
But there is a church where they teach all about it
Take me there, won't you take me there
There is a book we must not be without it
Take me there, I will read with you there
There is an altar where sins are forgiven
Take me there, yes I'll kneel with you there
We'll find there the God of Eternal Living
Take me there, He will take you there
There is no sorrow and no heartache there
There is no crying and no dying there
Won't you take me there, won't you take me there
Hallelujah won't you take me there"
"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do
[Chorus]
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la,
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days
Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say
[Chorus]
Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me
[Chorus]
Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same
[Chorus]"
"In the airport lounge he sat with his cane and derby hat
The grandest man that I had ever seen
Outside the heavy rains had grounded all the planes
So I asked him if he'd like some company
In my rhinestone-studded suit and my cowgirl high-heel boots
I must have been a site for him to see
But he said, ""Pull up a chair"", as I fumbled with my hair
A more unlikely pair you'll never see
I was Mogan David wine, he was Chablis fifty-nine
But there we sat, the cowgirl and the dandy
He was ski resorts in Aspen and summers in Paris
I was Grand Ole Opry, Nashville, Tennessee
The cowgirl and the dandy as different as can be
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee
Then somewhere in between, his Harvey's Bristol cream
And the beer that I kept sippin' at his table
We somehow came together for a night of stormy weather
Now there's a little bit of class in this old cabin
An' there's a little bit of country in the dandy
Cowgirl and the dandy as different as can be
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee
I was Mogan David wine, he was Chablis fifty-nine
But there we sat, the cowgirl and the dandy
He was ski resorts in Aspen and summers in Paris
I was Grand Ole Opry, Nashville, Tennessee
He was ski resorts in Aspen and summers in Paris
I was Grand Ole Opry, Nashville, Tennessee"
"Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as goneI stand here in the doorway of the room where you lie sleeping
In hopes that I don't wake you up with the sounds of my weeping
It breaks my heart to see you laying there
Alone in the bed we used to share
'Cause you no longer want me and I wonder what went wrong
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone
There's so much more between us than just these lonely walls
The echoes of our dying love lingers in the halls
Living separately together in a house that's not a home
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone
Through the eyes of a broken heart, I watch my whole world fall apart
I'm trying to revive a love that's died
Hopelessly I'm holding on to a love I know is gone
Gone, but not because I haven't tried
Disappearing from your door way now the hurt is twice as strong"
"(Porter Wagoner)
Darling you know, you know I love you like I love no other
And you told me, remember when you told me, you'd forget her in time
Time passes by but still you can't forget her, it looks like you can't forget her
Oh and that makes me wonder if you'll ever, ever be mine
There's no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart
While there's another, another still on your mind
There's no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart
Not when there's another, another still on your mind
There's just no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart
Not while there's another, another still on your mind, still on your mind"
"There's nothing left to tie us to each other anymore
The love we knew is gone and that's a fact we can't ignore
There's nothing left to loose ends on all the ties that bind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
There's no use in wasting the good years that we have left
When we might find happiness with somebody else
There's no chance for us we can see it we're not blind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
The blame belongs to both of us I guess we didn't try
Love is like a garden without care we let it die
The flower of love can't bloom if the sun don't ever shine
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
[ piano ]
The blame belongs to both of us...
Though it hurts we know we must leave it all behind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
You're wasting mine you're wasting mine"
"If you've been wonderin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin', too
Well I just sittin' here lovin' you
Close my eyes an' lovin' you
I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
An' I have been wonderin' just what I would do
If I weren't sleepin', had I not found you
Well I'd be outside findin' you
I'd be walkin' on the avenue findin' you
Well, I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
Now the reason that you never see me runnin' 'round
Fingers on my forehead couldn't calm me down
An' he can't even get me up and on my feet
When I've got to take care of some business on the street
I have been walkin' all my streets alone
But I won't keep walkin' to keep from goin' home
Couldn't quite barely concieve of you
Aw, an' I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
If you've been wonderin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin', too
Well I just sittin' here lovin' you
I just close my eyes an' lovin' you
Aw, an' I'm just sittin' back sittin' here lovin' you"
"The gates and doors were barred
And all the windows fastened down
I spent the night in sleeplessness
And rose at every sound
Half in hope of sorrow
And half in fear the day
Would find the soldiers breakin' through
To drag us all away
And just before the sunrise
I heard something at the wall
The gate began to rattle
And a voice began to call
I hurried to the window
Looked down into the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldiers' feet
But there was no one there but Mary
So I went down to let her in
John stood there beside me
As she told me where she'd been
She said they've moved Him in the night
And none of us know where
The stone's been rolled away
And now His body isn't there
We both ran towards the garden
Then John ran on ahead
We found the stone and empty tomb
Just the way that Mary said
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in
Was just an empty shell
And how or where they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell
Oh something strange had happened there
Just what I did not know
John believed a miracle
But I just turned to go
Circumstance and speculation
Couldn't lift me very high
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him
Then I saw Him die
Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything I'd promised Him
Just added to my shame
When at last it came to choices
I denied I knew His name
And even if He was alive
It wouldn't be the same
But suddenly the air was filled
With a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from everywhere
Drove shadows from the room
And Jesus stood before me
With His arms held open wide
And I fell down on my knees
And I just clung to Him and cried
Then He raised me to my feet
And as I looked into His eyes
The love was shining out from Him
Like sunlight from the skies
Guilt in my confusion
Disappeared in sweet release
And every fear I ever had
Just melted into peace
He's alive yes He's alive
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive yes He's alive
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive
Hallelujah He's alive
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive He's alive
I believe it He's alive
Sweet Jesus"
"(Dolly Parton)
I used to sit for hours as a kid
Dangle my feet from an old flat bridge,
Seein' myself in the water below
Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw
I recall a vacant old shack
Down by the edge of the tobaccer patch
A child's reflection in a dirty window
Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
I'm far from perfect, but I ain't all bad;
It hurts me more than it makes me mad
You gather your stones by stoopin' so low
Then shatter my image with the stones you throw
If you live in a glass house, don't throw stones
Don't shatter my image 'til you look at your own
Look at your reflection in your house of glass
Don't open my closet if your own's full of trash
Stay out of my closet if your own's full of trash
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
Don't shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw"
"As we were dressing to go out our little girl and boy
Came in and asked if they could go this time
We told them little girls and boys don't belong at parties
And that they should be in bed asleep by nine
The babysitter came in then and we kissed the kids goodbye
And told them that we'd be home soon and told them not to cry
Then we left for the party like we'd so often done
Thinking only of ourselves and not our little ones
The party started out wild and it grew wilder as the night wore on
With drinking laughing telling dirty jokes nobody thinkin' of home
Then the strangest feeling came over me and it chilled me to the bones
And I told my wife that we'd better leave the party
Cause I felt that we were needed at home
As we rode along I got to thinking of how the kids that morning
Had asked if we would take them to church the next day
And how I'd put 'em off like I'd so often done
By saying we'd probably get home too late
Then my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of sirens
As they cut through the still night air
Then we turned down our street that's when we saw the fire
The rest was like a nightmare
We took their little bodies to church the next day
Though we'd left the party early we still got home too late"
"(Dolly Parton)
I know that you're out there
Knowing that there's someone out here thinkin' of you
In your heart and in your mind
I know there is no doubt that someone loves you
And I know that you know
That I'll be waiting here when you have need of me
And when the world has chained you down
I know you know my love will set you free
How does it feel to know that someone loves you
How does it feel to know that someone's always thinkin' of you
Oh and how does it feel to know that someone puts no one above you
How does it feel to know that someone loves you, someone loves you
I have come to know and love you
Like I've never known or loved another
Words have not been made
That could describe these feelings we have for each other
And I would go to any length
To let you know at all times that I care
'Cause I want you to know
That any time you reach for me you'll find me there
How does it feel to know that someone loves you
How does it feel to know that someone's always thinkin' of you
Oh and how does it feel to know that someone puts no one above you
How does it feel to know that someone loves you, someone loves you"
"From the start I promised you that I would always be
Waiting here at anytime you ever needed me
I loved you then and I love you now as I always will
And I am always waiting willing to forgive
I'll be your shelter from the storm
My love will keep you safe and warm
I'm a harbor on your stormy sea you can always come to me
For I am always waiting
My arms are always open wide and I will dry the tears you cried
If you should ever need someone darling let it be me
I will mend your broken heart and I'll replace the missing parts
I am always waiting anytime you need me
I'll be your shelter from the storm...
For I am always waiting"
"I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You think you know the smile on her lips
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You think you'll find heaven of bliss
In each caress, in each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You stole her love from me one day
You didn't care, oh, it hurt me
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be.
You think she's yours, to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn, when her love grows cold
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her."
"(Dolly Parton)
Nothing new, nothing different, nothing better, nothing more
Nothing else to give you I didn't give before
I gave my love completely, my heart was always yours
It wouldn't do, I still lost you
You want to give it one chance; Don't know why we should
We'd never get that far again or make the love that good
We had our chance, we blew it; And I'll never understand
Careless fools, I still lost you
You want to fan the flames of love, stir up passion's fire
Conjure up familiar lusts, stir up past desires
What we had then, we don't have now; And I would just compare
I refuse, I still lost you
Too late for starting over, it hardly ever works
Too many missing pieces, too much water, too much hurt
I already lost you once, and that makes matters worse
What's the use, I still lost you
Oh you want to fan the flames of love, stir up passion's fire
Conjure up familiar lusts, stir up past desires
What we had then, we don't have now; And I would just compare
I refuse, I still lost you
Oh what's the use, I still lost you
I lost you"
"(Dolly Parton)
Spotlight's on, it's shining bright
And I like standin' in it
It's only superficial light
But I don't want to end it
It's warmth and glow has taken hold
And I'm caught uup in it's shine
A Cinderella fairy tale
I want to claim as mine
Fancy clothes, a magic coach
And happy ever after
Like something from a story book
The Cinderella chapter
But when the clock strikes midnight
And I lie awake in bed
Things my Daddy told me
Keep running through my head
You gotta walk the straight and narrow
And to thine own self be true
Gotta aim straight as an arrow
All eyes are up on you
But sometimes it feels so good
That I can almost justify
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Is it wrong for me to want
The sweeter grass that's greener?
To chase the all-American dream
I've always been a dreamer
At the top and still I've got
A heavy heart inside
I keep remembering
Things my Daddy told me as a child
You gotta walk the striaght and narrow
Gotta hold fast to the right
Gotta aim straight as an arrow
Walk onward toward the light
Oh, but when I'm out there in it
I think I might get by
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
But I don't feel right livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
All the fame and fortune
Glory and prestige
Can't make me happy if it goes
Against what I believe
And I've sacrificed my honor
My values and my pride
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, I don't feel right"
"Remember all the castles that we once built in the sand
Remember how we used to go and visit fairy land
Remember how we'd search for that pot of gold at the rainbow's end
But you loved me then
And the flowers the we picked from the fields where we did run
And the sunbeams that we'd catch from the summer's golden sun
And the butterflies we'd chase as we'd go running through the wind
But you loved me then
Now I walk through the ruins of our castles in the sand
When you left I lost my way forever and the fairy land
Now the rainbows have all gone and the flowers have all died
And the sunbeams that we caught have all gone free again
And the butterfiles we chased have all gone with the wind
And you no longer care but you love me then
(And you no longer care) but you love me then
(And you no longer care) but you love me then"
"(Lee Fikes)
I'm gonna get on that old turnpike and I'm gonna ride
I'm gonna leave this town 'til you decide
Which one you want the most, them Opery stars or me
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville, Tennessee
Milwaukee's where we were before we came here
Working in a brewery, making the finest beer
She came to me on a payday night, said
""Let's go to Tennessee,"" so we came down to Nashville to the Grand Ole Opery
We turned on the TV, Porter Wagoner was singing loud
I said that's the man for me, I love him, there's no doubt
I'm leaving now see if I can find out where he's at
And if I can't find him, I'll settle for that bluegrass Lester Flatt"
"I flew off to the wild blue yonder
'Cause I had a dream
And I had to go
But I'm filled with a sense of wonder
From the love I shared
With a green-eyed boy
Lips as sweet as mountain honey
A body warm as home made wine
But he had no dreams
And no means for money
But he had me just anytime
Take me back, If just in memory
Fill my cup again with joy
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy
Now he was pretty
With chiseled features
Like the movie stars in the magazines
My first love and the son of a preacher
I fantasized me was James Dean
But the world outside kept pulling at me
Offered me fame, respect, and gold
Designer clothes and a fancy mansion
Expensive cars, so I chose those
Take me back, If just in memory
Fill my cup again with joy
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy
Take me back, If just in memory
Fill my cup again with joy
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy
Ooh, ooh, how I love that green-eyed boy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, and I still miss
That green-eyed boy
Do you think about me
When the nights are long and cold
Do you ever miss me
Do you my green-eyed boy"
"(Porter Wagoner)
He walks in my mind like a shadow
Someone speaks his name and he appears
I can see his face in total darkness
Oh, he's everywhere
He left a memory that lives with me
A memory of how it used to be
And I remember all the things we used to share
Oh, he's everywhere
He waits in the corners of my mind
And in the stillness of the night, he walks around
Sometimes his memory's so real I think he's really there
Oh, he's everywhere
He left a memory that lives with me
A memory of how it used to be
I remember all the things we used to share
Oh, he's everywhere
Oh, he's everywhere"
"A light shines from my window
I just can't sleep no more
Lord, it hurts so much to be alone
But the real men never do admit
That it's them that might be wrong
At least that's what he told me in his song
He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind
The freedom that he sings about
I guess I'll never know
I just can't shake the guilt or kill the pain
But he lets me ride when the lights turns low
Get on board the radio and take a ride to Texas on his train
He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind"
"(Rachel Parton Dennison)
I am ready
Oh, my children
When Jesus knocks at my door
I'll be there come morning
Don't weep for me
I'll be with my Lord
There's my bible on the table
Read it to me once more
I can hear God's heavenly angels
Singing me on through heaven's door
Hallelujah Lord
I am ready
No more sorrow
Hallelujah, yes
I am ready, I am ready
I am ready to go"
"On a park bench on sunny afternoon
Sat a young boy and a girl bout seventeen
As we stood so closely by watched them hold each other's hand
On their faces love had written we're making plans
Then he said to her you're my guiding light
Then she said to him you make my whole world seem so bright
Then we saw their books of braille and that neither one could see
Then I thought how close they must be
Souch tenderness my eyes have never seen
Two young lovers both just in their teens
Though their world gives them no light they see much more than you and me
Don't you know how close they must be
Then a car stopped just a few steps away
And a voice said Jim and Jeannie it's time to go
With their hands still clutched so tight helping each other to the car
Can you imagine just how close they are
Don't you know how close they must be"
"What will I do when you are gone?
Who's gonna tell me the truth?
Who's gonna finish the stories I start,
The way you always do?
When somebody knocks at the door,
Someone new walks in
I will smile and shake their hands,
But you can't make old friends
You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
It was me and you, since way back when
But you can't make old friends
How will I sing when you are gone?
'Cause it won't sound the same
Who'll join in on those harmony parts,
When I call your name?
You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
It was you and me, since way back when
You can't make old friends
When Saint Peter opens the gate,
And you come walking in
I'll be there just waiting for you
'Cause you can't make old friends
'Cause you can't make old friends, no no
When I'm out on the stage all alone
And I hear the music begin
We all know the show must go on
But you can't make old friends, no no
You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
And you and me, will be young again
You can't make old friends
You and me, will be together again
'Cause we both know, we will still be old friends
You can't make old friends
Not the way we have always been"
"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you,
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling ""Yoo hoo,""
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
Let's go, Let's look at the show,
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
It's grand, Just holding your hand,
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land.
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you."
"I don't know why I like him, I just only know I do
I don't know why I trust him, I just know his heart is true
I don't know why he's more a man than any man I know
I don't know how I know the man's for real but I still know
The man is more than what meets the eye
He is worn and weary from life
He is rugged but he's got style
The man has got what matters inside
Weary, yes, he must get weary but he doesn't say
But you can read between the lines that wind along his face
The man has got his memories that he hides inside his mind
And you can see the sadness in the eyes they hide behind
The man is more than what meets the eye
He is worn and weary from life
He is rugged but he's got style
The man has got what matters inside
Love him, yes, I've always loved him and I always will
He holds a place in my heart no one else could ever fill
He's always been my hero, the best friend I've ever had
The man is something special and I'm proud that he's my dad
The man is more than what meets the eye
He is worn and weary from life
He is rugged but he's got style
The man has got what matters inside"
"It's too late
You say you want me and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now
It's too bad
You say you need me and it's too bad
I know the feelin' and it's so sad
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now
Don't you know how hard I tried
To hold out just for you?
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day

Turned my dreams around

"Well the two new people that's moved to the middle of the block
And we're at the top of the town and don't you think we're not
Well we found love and happiness people envy us you see
For we found heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33
Yes we found what most people are looking for
And it's not a lotta money to spend on real fine car
But it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
And there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 4-0-33
Four thousandth block proves what true love can do
Once a lonely place but was sold to me and you
Oh all around the house you can see little children play
But they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
They are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
They're a part of heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33
[ steel - el.banjo ]
Our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
For look at the house they think there from the sky
They think this place would make them as happy as you and me
And the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 4-0-33
Four thousandth block proves what true love can do...
And we're not gonna sale our happy little house at 4-0-33
Wouldn't take a pretty thing for the love we had at 4-0-33"
"(Dolly Parton)
Take my hand and run with me
Out of the past of yesterday
And walk with me into the future of tomorrow
Yesterday must be forgot
No looking back no matter what
There's nothing there but mem'ries that bring sorrow
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever
No more crying tears leave tracks
And mem'ries find their way back
Tomorrow's waiting let's journey there together
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever
I care not for yesterday I love you as you are today
Yesterday just helped to pass the time while waiting
We must forget the passing time
My love for you is the real kind
The kind that won't hurt you, oh never
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever"

"So I feel so blue sometimes I want to die and so I've got a broken heart so what
They say that time will heal all wounds in mice and men
And I know that someday I'll forget and love again
But just between you and me I've got my doubts about it
Just between you and me you're too much to forget
So I've lost the only one I've ever loved and so I've never felt so low so what
I'll just tell myself each time I want to cry
That someday time will dry the teardrops from my eyes
Just between you and me I'm not so sure about it
Just between you and me you're too much to forget
You're too much to forget"
"Every time you talk about your love
We always end up in the deepest despair
Cause you're so afraid you won't ever have enough
Even though I say it's gonna be there
You may not be good at taking chances
But don't be afraid to win or lose
You don't know who you want to romance with
But you wouldn't be feelin' blue
If you knew what you put me through
Chorus:
You're the only one that I ever needed
You're the only one that I ever cared for
You're the only one that I ever needed
You're the only one that I ever cared for
Everywhere I look, I see you
And I do all I can to keep it that way
But even now when you're trying to believe me
A miracle of tears gets in the way
You may not be good at taking chances
But don't be afraid to win or lose
You don't who you want to romance with
But you wouldn't be feelin' blue
If you knew what you put me through
Repeat Chorus Twice
Repeat Chorus To Fade"

I love you, I love you
My heart seems to whisper
But my lips cannot form those words
I know my heart
Is calling out to you
In a voice you've already heard
Does your heart feel as if
It could burst any second
Is it racing, will not slow up
Do you just want to be
With me endlessly
Well I'm thinking
We might be in love
We might be in love
The best I can tell
I thinkin' thoughts
That I've never pondered
And I'm feeling like I've never felt
It's like I drink
From some magic posion
Sipping from your loving cup
Intoxicated, infatuated
I'm thinking we might be in love
We might be in love
What else could it be
These feelings of wonder
Passion and romance
Excitement and pure ectasy
We might be in love
And it might be forever
I think there's a future for us
If you just want to be
In and all over me
It might be, we might be in love
I promise for keeps
If you're feeling like me
Then it might be
We might be in love
I dare say
We might be in love"
"As blue skies and daylight darken into night
Surrounding us with beauty as the stars make their light
They spell out our names all the stars up above
As they flicker and shine like letters of love
Then a warm breath of air whispers through the trees
As the leaves on their branches have blown to the breeze
Ripples of water seemed to echo the sound
Love's out tonight there's love all around
Small drops of dew act as nature's perfume
Placing its fragrance on all that's in blue
While I hold you so close your lips touching mine
With nature all around us watching our love entwine
Love's out tonight see the candles in the sky
God lend us the heavens tonight for you and I
A night full of love for all the world to see
Love's out tonight all around you and me
Love's out tonight"
"(Dolly Parton)
I look at you and I see something special
I feel something special, something that's rare
If you feel the same way when you're lookin' at me
I know there could be a love we could share
Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the things that we need
Won't you come and love with me
We'll sing us a love song the songbirds would envy
A song that the angels would be proud to sing
We'll say with our hearts what no poet could capture
Say with our eyes what no artist could paint
Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the love that we need
Won't you come and love with me"
"When the mornin' sun
Streaks across my room
And I'm wakin' up
From another dream of you
Yes, you know I'm on the road
Once again it seems
All that's left behind
Is a chain of broken dreams
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you
And how I wish that love
Was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have
'Cause I've got so much to give
But ya' know I feel so sad
Down inside my heart
That the dollar sign
Should be keepin' us apart
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
And if only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life
Had not yet crossed my mind
And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come runnin' back to you
I'd come runnin' back to you
But you know we can't
Live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent
So I must leave you all alone
'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago
And now this travelin' life
Well, it's the only life I know
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know I love you
But you know I love you
Oh, I love you
But you know that I love you
But you know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know that I love you
But you know that I love you"
"All your love lifting me higher
Than I ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
Then I'll be at your side forevermore
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
Now once I was downhearted
This little loneliness my foes and friend
But when you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
I'm so glad I finally found you
Yes that one in a million girl
And now with my loving arms around you
I can stand up and face the world
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher"
"At my door the leaves are fallin'
A cold wild wind will come
Sweet hearts walked by together
And I still miss someone
I go out to a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Cause I still miss someone
Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there"

It's been a long dark night
And I've been a waitin' for the morning
It's been a long hard fight
But I see a brand new day a dawning
I've been looking for the sunshine
'Cause I ain't seen it in so long
But everything's gonna work out just fine
Everything's gonna be all right
That's been all wrong
'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
And everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay
It's been a long long time
Since I've known the taste of freedom
And those clinging vines
That had me bound, well I don't need 'em
'Cause I am strong and I can prove it
And I got my dreams to see me through
It's just a mountain, I can move it
And with faith enough there's nothing I can't do
And I can see the light of a clear blue morning
And I can see the light of brand new day
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
And everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a brand new day
Yes I can see the light of a clear blue morning
And everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
Everything's gonna be all right
It's gonna be okay
'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning
I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Yes I can see the light of a clear blue morning
Everything's gonna be all right

"Once more to be with you dear
Just for tonight to hold you tight

And say you'll give me all of your heart
Once more to be with you dear...
Once more to be with you dear..."
"If you're trying to reach Heaven
you talk to Jesus, you talk to Him every day.
'Cause Jesus knows, He knows that you are coming

you get down on your knees and pray
and give your heart and your soul to Jesus.
Heaven's just a prayer away.
You are just one prayer from Heaven
as you travel down life's highway.
Just when you think that you can't make it,
well, Heaven's just a prayer away.

you get down on your knees and pray
and give your heart and give your soul to Jesus.
Heaven's just a prayer away.

"Big wind big wind's comin'
From daylight till dusk we've been a workin' in the dust
Pickin' cotton workin' side by side
Oh I can't forget I still remember yet the way my daddy looked at me and cried
Big wind's a comin' listen to the hummin' hurry up now be quick don't stall
You know we can't be slow take the kids and get below
If we don't hurry it'll surely get us all
I ran across the field so scared my lips was scaled
To warn my mom to storm was on its way
Now I knew I'd won the race when I'd see my mama's face
And the way she looked at me and said
Big wind's a comin'
Oh but dad was on the cellar and by now the sky was yellow
The wind was blowin' trees were fallin'
And outside I heard him cryin' and as he lay there dyin'
It seemed I could still hear him sayin'
Big wind's a comin'
Big wind big wind's comin'"
"I ain't got no business here
You have made it very clear
So I'm leaving
Leaving this old town
My wings are kinda broken up

Time and only time can tell
If I'm to find Heaven or Hell
Then I'm leaving
I'm just leaving
I have given all I can
I've tried but you don't understand
So I'm leaving
I'm talking big for someone so small
I know I'll be alright out there
Even so, I'm just a little scared
But that's strictly just between us
And that's all
I'm gonna be alright
I'm going to Paradise

"There is a house down in New Orleans
Down in the Vieux Carr'e
A house they call the rising sun
Where love and money are made
My father he was a gambler
Mother died when I was young
And I've worked since then
To please the men
At the house of the rising sun
There is a house
Down in New Orleans
They call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh God, you know I'm one
So mothers you go telling all your daughters
Not to do what I've done
To live a life of sin, shame and strife
In the house of the rising sun"

I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
Oh I never got over those blue eyes

"If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my children and my wife
I'd thank my lucky stars
To be living here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.
From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston
And New York to L.A.
Well there's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me

"Last Saturday night I looked like a princess dressed in calico
Now blue Monday washday I look like a lady hobo
Just rubbin' and a scrubbin' and a raisin' 'em out
I gotta hang 'em out early I hope the sun comes out
(Wash 'em out ring 'em out hang 'em on the line
Get a little tired just think about the good times) washday blues
Now I ain't never been very lucky I ain't never won a prize
But I'd like to get a job on TV for some of that soap they advertise
Rubbin' and scrubbin...
Well that good lookin' good lovin' no good man of mine
Could buy me a washin' machine
But he spends all his money on payday to make me look like a queen
Now rubbin' and scrubbin'..."

When I'm kissing you - I taste the sun and rain
When I look at you - I hear the angels sing

You lied to me
I can't believe
That I've been such a fool
I thought this time
I might find
Someone who would play by the rules
My mind said no
But my heart said go
And again I've made the wrong turn
Now here I stand
My heart in your hands...
And I've gone from burning to burned
Ah, you'd think by now
I'd know how
To keep this heart of mine safe
It goes to show
You just never know
Who can you trust these days
How could I make
The same mistake
But as far as I'm concerned
Got myself to blame
Got to close to the flame
Now I've gone from burning to burned
Everyone knows
The old saying goes
That a fool in love
Never learns
But I guess I forgot
'Cause the fire was too hot...
Now I've gone from burning to burned
Oh I guess I forgot
'Cause the fire was too hot...
Now I've gone from burning to burned"
"Well the two new people that's moved to the middle of the block
And we're at the top of the town and don't you think we're not
Well we found love and happiness people envy us you see
For we found heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33
Yes we found what most people are looking for
And it's not a lotta money to spend on real fine car
But it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
And there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 4-0-33
Four thousandth block proves what true love can do
Once a lonely place but was sold to me and you
Oh all around the house you can see little children play
But they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
They are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
They're a part of heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33
[ steel - el.banjo ]
Our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
For look at the house they think there from the sky
They think this place would make them as happy as you and me
And the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 4-0-33
Four thousandth block proves what true love can do...
And we're not gonna sale our happy little house at 4-0-33
Wouldn't take a pretty thing for the love we had at 4-0-33"
"Life's like poetry and in my poem bay
Until now there's always been a missing line
You know life's too short to hide a good thing you feel
And I find the morning after
Is the best time to determine if it's real
Baby, finding you gave my whole world reason to rhyme
'Cause life's like poetry and in my poem bay
Until now there's always been a missing line
Life's too short to think about right or wrong
And the only thing I wonder 'bout
Is where you been so long
'Cause baby finding you gave my whole world reason and rhyme
And life's like poetry and in my poem bay
Until now there's always been a missing line
Until now, there's always been a missing line"
"Let's start by stopping long enough to talk things over
Since there's a new love burning between us
With open-minded understanding between us
Let's both feel free to talk of this new love
Let there be no deep dark secrets between us
Let's never hide behind a false disguise
Let there be no hidden feelings between us
An honest love is a love that will survive
In our love let's share a friendship between us
Always close enough to talk things out
Let's be honest with ourselves and with each other
And our love will never know mistrust or doubt
Let there be no deep dark secrets...
An honest love is a love that will survive"
"Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
The fireplace keeps burning and my thoughts keep turning
The pages of memories of time spent with you
Old Christmas songs we knew and used to make love to
Make it hard to get used to
Christmas without you
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you
Like a mystery with no clues
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
The sweetest gift I know would be if the new snow
Could fall on your footsteps on this Christmas Eve
The most joyous Christmas if luck could be with us
Would be if Saint Nicholas brought you home to me
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you I need you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you, like a mystery with no clues
Like fireworks with no fuse
Christmas without you
Christmas without you
White Christmas and I'm blue
I love you I miss you
So sad but so true
Christmas without you, not something I can get used to
I just have no use
For Christmas without you
You know that I want you
You know that I need you
You know that I need you
You know that I want you
You know that I love you
I need you
I want you
Oh, yes I do!

I have to run your water
And I have to wash your back

But where's your helpin' hand

If you raised a hand to help
Well, I'm not gonna keep it up

Well a good ways down the railroad track
There was this little old rundown shack
And in it lived a man I'd never seen
Folks said he was a mean and a vicious man
And you better not set foot on his land
I didn't think nobody could be that mean
So I took me out walking down the railroad track
I was a-gonna go down to that little old shack
And just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
There was a big black dog laying out in the yard
And it growled at me and I swallowed hard
And I heard somebody say well who are you
Oh and there he stood in the door of that shack
His beard and his hair was long and black
And he was the biggest man I'd ever seen
When he spoke his voice was low and deep
But he just didn't frighten me
'Cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean
He said what you doing snooping 'round my place
And I saw a smile come across his face
So I smiled back and I told him who I was
He said come on in and pull you up a chair
You might as well since you already here
And he said you can call me Joshua
Joshua Joshua
Whatcha doing living here all alone
Joshua Joshua
Ain't you got nobody to call your own
No no no no
We talked 'til the sun was clean out of sight
And we still talking when it come daylight
And there was just so much we had to say hey
I'd spent my life in an orphan's home
And just like him I was all alone
So I said yeah when he asked if I'd stay
Oh we grew closer as time went on
And that little old shack it was a happy home
And we just couldn't help but fall in love
That big black dog and that little old shack
Sitting down by the railroad track
It's plenty good enough for me and Joshua
Joshua Joshua
Why you're just what I've been looking for
Joshua Joshua
You ain't gonna be lonesome anymore
No no
Yodel-a-he-ho
Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua yeah yeah

"Two sides to every story we can't stay this out if we'll take time
Two sides to every story you tell yours and I tell mine
Well where were you last night when I came home
When I came in you were out and gone
Well I waited up till up to two then I went downtown to look for you
So how's about tellin' me where you were at
Well me and the boys stopped off for a drink or two
(Now ain't you a pretty thing)
Well we got to drinkin' and I guess that time just flew
Well the time must've flown for you alright
Cause I thought you're gonna stay out all night
And I told myself I ain't a puttin' up to that
There's always two sides to every story...
You said you went downtown to look for me
Did you have to dress up fancy as could be
You know I never leave the house you know jacky clothes lookin' like slut
And I's downtown just to look in my best for you
Now I'm not accusin' you of doin' wrong
But that's awful late for you to be out and gone
Now look who's talkin' bout bein' late and I wasn't about to sit and wait
Why you were at that when with no tellin' who"
"I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time
But that was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine
But that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
I thought I'd stay single always be free
But that was before I met you
I said that no sweet thang could ever hold me
But that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
That was before I met you"

I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
You say that wasn't you I saw with someone else last night
You say you've never done me wrong you've always treated me right
I know it was dark but not that dark and I'm not that blind
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I'm fed up with you and the way that you do
I used to love you now I change my mind
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I once believed everything you've said I was so in love with you
You said I was the only one now I know that wasn't true
Now I know just where I stand I'm tidin' your cheatin' line
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I'm fed up with you...
I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line"

When it's family, you accept them, 'cause you have no choice but to
When it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you
And they always put you to the test
And you always try to do your best
And just pray for God to do the rest, when it's family
Some are preachers, some are gay
Some are addicts, drunks and strays
But not a one is turned away, when it's family
Some are lucky, others ain't
Some are fighters, others faint
Winners, losers, sinners, saints, it's all family
And when it's family you trust them and your heart's an open door
When it's family, you tolerate what you'd kill others for
When it's family, you love and hate and take, then give some more
Somehow you justify mistakes, try to find some better way
To solve the problems day to day, in the family
You take the trouble as it comes and love them more than anyone
Good or bad or indifferent, it's still family
You choose your lovers, you pick your friends
Not the family that you're in, nah
They'll be with you 'til the end, 'cause it's family
And when it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do
When it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you
When it's family, when it's family
Let me be all that I should be to the family"
"Oh jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Hey jingle bells jingle bells
Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight
Oh jingle bells jingle bells
Oh jingle bells jingle bells"
"I couldn't believe it the day that you left
Cleaned out your closet, cleared off your shelves
Loaded your car and you drove out of sight
But I never said goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open, I leave on a light
I'm always waiting in case you drop by
I'll never say goodbye
People have told me you have a new love
My heart's not willing to give up on us
I've convinced myself they're just telling me lies
And I'll never say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open, I leave on a light
I never wanted you out of my life
And I'll never say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open, I leave on a light
I'll be loving you till the day that I die
And I'll never say goodbye
If you'll just come back, I won't even ask why
I'll never say goodbye, no, I'll never say goodbye"
"They say that it's a matter of trusting
Before love has a chance to begin
And it's never simple
Faithless hearts can cripple
And only a strong love survives
I know they say that it's a fine line
Between giving up and giving in
But once your heart's been in it
You just can't forget it
It's like nothing that you've felt in your life
[Chorus:]
We got real love
Not infatuation
Real love
Our hearts' celebration
I love you
Real love
Not an imitation
Real love
You're my destination
Baby, you and me
We got everything we need
You are such a part of my life
That I can't remember me without you
And we've had our nights
We've had our share of fights
But we've never thought of giving it up
Oh, you and I we must be dreamers
'Cause we're making our dreams come true
I could spend my life
Just holding you so tight
And never, ever get enough
[Chorus]
We got real love
[Repeat Chorus]"
"(Dolly Parton)
Bartender won't you pour me a very strong drink
Just keep it coming till I don't have to think
And point out some cowboy that might want to dance
And make sure I get home if you see that I can't
You see I loved him, he left me for a girl half my age
I relate to each sad song that ole jukebox has played
I listen to Haggard, ole Hank, and George Jones
But why don't more women sing honky tonk songs?
Why don't more women sing honky-tonk songs?
About the heartaches and the tough breaks
And the men that's done 'em wrong
There are others just like me that are hurtin' to the bone
So why don't more women sing honky-tonk songs
Why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
Honky tonk angels are just queens without thrones
Judge not lest you be judged, who can cast the first stone
Why don't more women sing honky-tonk songs
Bartender won't you pour me a very strong drink
Just keep it coming till I don't have to think
And point out some cowboy that might want to dance
And make sure I get home if you see that I can't
(All you lonely women sing)
Why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
About the heartaches and the tough breaks
And all the men that's done us wrong
There's a whole lotta women I know would sing along
So why don't more women sing honky tonk songs
Why don't more women sing honky tonk songs"
"To be with you is what I want more than anything
But I must share my life with the one who wears my ring
And there are tiny places I look into each night
I love you but my hands are tied
I know how much they need you and dear I understand
I know you'll never leave them cause you're not that kind of man
But I can't control my feelings though heaven knows I tried
And I love you but my hands are tied
My hands are tied and I can't break the ties that bind
I love you more than life but you never will be mine
I know how much you want me I can see it in your eyes
And I love you but my hands are tied
[ steel ]
My hands are tied and I can't break the ties that bind...
Yes I love you but my hands are tied"
"I met you and we married we planned our future well
We built our home on happiness then suddenly it fell
It wasn't long there after our love began to tilt
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built
First came the weekly parties that never seemed to end
And then came the heartbreak brought by so-called friends
I guess that I'm as much to blame while we share the guilt
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built
First came the weekly parties...
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built"

It ain't fair for you to leave me cold and cryin' in the night
It ain't fair to take your body from my arms and out of sight
It ain't fair you've gone and left me where you kissed me I still burn
Are you leaving for my loving this awful hurt and then return
It ain't fair for you to leave me alone to face the morning light
It ain't fair you took my body and then to say that it ain't right
It ain't fair you've made me your woman a no longer a good girl in your eyes
How come before you said you'd love me it ain't fair that it ain't right
It just ain't fair that it ain't right"
"When I look out over a green field of clover
Or watch the sun set at the end of the day
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty
And everything's beautiful in its own way
When I see a fountain flow from a mountain
Or see April showers bring flowers to May
I can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder
And everything's beautiful in its own way
Words can't describe what I feel inside
When I see the beauty in each coming day
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
And everything's beautiful in its own way
When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger
The storm's even beautiful in its own way
When I see leaves drop off from the treetop
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder
God made all things beautiful in their own way"
"And so you have come back to me
And say the old love's growin' yet
You've tried through all these weary years
You've tried to vainly to forget
Oh no, I cannot take your hand
God never gives is back our youth
The lovin' heart you slighted then
Was yours, my friend in perfect truth
Come close and let me see your face
Your raven hair is tinged with snow
Oh, yes, it is the same dear face
I loved so many years ago
Oh no, I cannot take your hand
God never gives is back our youth
The lovin' heart you slighted then
Was yours, my friend in perfect truth
Farewell, I think I love you yet
As friend to friend, God bless you dear
And guide you through these weary years
To where the skies are always clears
Oh no, I cannot take your hand
God never gives is back our youth
The lovin' heart you slighted then
Was yours, my friend in perfect truth
Oh no, I cannot take your hand
God never gives is back our youth
The lovin' heart you slighted then
Was yours, my friend in perfect truth"
"Momma moved out
Daddy sold the house
They split up the money
And went on their way
And all the king's horses
And all the king's men
Couldn't put mommy and daddy back together again
Starting over again
Where should they begin
Cause they've never been out on their own
Starting over again
Where do you begin
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And the whole world cries
Got an apartment
She moved in with her sisters
He's scheming big deals with one of his friends
While she sits at home
Just sorting out pieces
Of left over memories
From thirty odd years
Starting over again
Where do you begin
You've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
What will the neighbors say?
They're talking talk, it's small town news
Facing fifty years old
Making up a happy home
And this far down the road
You find yourself alone
Two fools
Starting over again
Now where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And all the king's horses
And all the king's men
Could never put mommy and daddy back together
Back together, again"

You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Strangers meet and they willingly surrender
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
Almost went to Aspen but something told me no
I considered Mammoth but there wasn't enough snow
And I even thought of Gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go
So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes
And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way
Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet
With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood
But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Change the radio and I'll turn the lights down dimmer
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
Strangers when we met, lovers as we leave
Christmas to remember, too good to believe
Don't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again
We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind
And you've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
We loved and laughed and played and joked
Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks
Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes
Then to the lodge for dinner
But now it's time for us to go
As our hearts melt like chimney snow
There's just one thing I want to know
Can we do this next winter
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers
Oh! What a Christmas to remember"
"There is a diamond inside of me
That lights up the sky of my soul
Where fell the diamond when I believed
That all of the hurt was my fault
[Chorus:]
I'm opening the heart door
Letting in the light
Opening the heart door
And giving life to me that died
You ended up so with that person
Who comes home too late from the bar
I ended up so when my courage
Could finally walk on its own
When I finally opened the door
[Chorus]"
"Last Saturday night I looked like a princess dressed in calico
Now blue Monday washday I look like a lady hobo
Just rubbin' and a scrubbin' and a raisin' 'em out
I gotta hang 'em out early I hope the sun comes out
(Wash 'em out ring 'em out hang 'em on the line
Get a little tired just think about the good times) washday blues
Now I ain't never been very lucky I ain't never won a prize
But I'd like to get a job on TV for some of that soap they advertise
Rubbin' and scrubbin...
Well that good lookin' good lovin' no good man of mine
Could buy me a washin' machine
But he spends all his money on payday to make me look like a queen
Now rubbin' and scrubbin'..."

From a shack by a mountain stream
To a room in New Orleans
So far from my Blue Ridge Mountain home
The men I meet ain't warm and friendly
Like the one in old Virginie
Oh they ain't real like my Blue Ridge Mountain boy
I was just a little past eighteen
When I came to New Orleans
I'd never been beyond my home state line
There was a boy who loved me dearly
But I broke his heart severely
When I left my Blue Ridge Mountain boy
Life was dull in my hometown
Lights were out when the sun went down
And I thought that city life was more my style
But nights get lonely away from home
And it's easy to go wrong
The men ain't kind like my Blue Ridge Mountain boy
New Orleans held things in store
Things I'd never bargained for
And every night a different man knocks on my door
But late at night when all is still
I can hear a whippoorwill
As I cry for my Blue Ridge Mountain boy
Oh but I can never go back home
Since the boy I love is gone
He grew tired of waiting for me to return
They say he married last October
But I never will get over
Oh the sweet love of my Blue Ridge Mountain boy
Blue Ridge Mountain boy"
"They say the love 'bove will get you at the age of twenty-three
Well I'm not tellin' my age but something got a hold on me
I'm just cravin' some lovin' in the old fashion way
Honey linger near and listen to all I had to say
Why don't you haul off and love me one more time
Why don't you squeeze me until I'm turning blind
If you don't cuddle off and love me like I want you to do
I'm gonna haul off and die over you
[ steel ]
I can feel your warm lips near me hear you breathe so soft and fine
I can feel the matrimony crawling up and down my spine
I don't believe this love will hurt you cause it feels so nice and kind
It seems mighty close to heaven when your love is on the line
Why don't you haul off and love me...
I'm a gonna haul off and die over you"
"Cry, cry darlin', that's what I'll do
If you should leave me with the blues
Cry, cry darlin', that's what I'll do
If you're the one that I should lose
For me there will be no moonlight
If ever we should part
Cry, cry darlin', that's all I'll do
'Cause you're the one that's in my heart
Cry, cry darlin', my eyes would cry
And never dry if you should go
Cry, cry darlin', when shadows creep
I'll just weep all night I know
You know how much I'd miss you
If ever we should part
Cry, cry darlin', that's all I'll do
'Cause you're the one that's in my heart"
"No matter how you're tempted
Don't say yes to me
Don't make this night as smooth to lead me on
It's just that I'm so lonely and I need someone
I've been too lonely too long
Oh please be strong enough to refuse me
Before I let myself do something wrong
For down inside I'm not that kind of woman
I've been too lonely too long
Oh please don't take advantage of the situation
For I'm afraid that I'm too weak to resist temptation
When you're used to being loved
It's hard to live alone
I've been too lonely too long
I've been too lonely too long"
"You packed in the morning
I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I miss you more
Than I missed you before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
Yes, you left me
Just when I needed you most
Now most every morning
I stare out the window
I think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me
'Cause I need you more
Than I needed before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
Yes, you left me
Just when I needed you most
You packed in the morning
I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I love you more
Than I loved you before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
You left me
Just when I needed you most
Oh, you left me
Just when I needed you most"
"Fresh scrubbed hot off the bus
Dressed up and feeling good
Eyes full of stars a heart full of dreams
Daisy Mae in Hollywood
Struttin' down the boulevard
The walkway of the stars
With a vision of her name in lights
Reflecting off the cars
And dreaming of a white limozeen
She wants to have a white limozeen
Well, the days to come were long and dark
And the nights were hard and cold
She met the devil in the City of Angels
But she never lost her soul
She kept her dreams close to her heart
Like a family photograph
She cried sometimes and died sometimes
But still she knows how to laugh
Dreaming of a white limozeen
Dreaming of a white limozeen
Now she's a living her dreams like a movie queen
Diamond rings and all things good
From the breadlines to the headlines
She's the toast of Hollywood
White limozeen
White limozeen
Now she's really ridin' high
She's a woman of the world
But deep inside she never changed
She's the same old down home girl
And when the airplane brings the kinfolk
To visit for awhile
There's a friendly guy in a red bow tie
To take 'em around in style
He drives 'em in a white limozeen
She finally got a white limozeen
Now she's a living her dreams like a movie queen
Diamond rings and all things good
From the breadlines to the headlines
She's the toast of Hollywood
She was fresh scrubbed hot off the bus
Dressed up and feelin' good
Eyes full of stars a heart full of dreams
Daisy Mae in Hollywood
She goes struttin' down the boulevard
The walkway of the stars
With a vision of her name in lights
Reflectin' off the cars
And dreamin' of a white limozeen
She finally got a white limozeen
Oh, ridin' in a white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen

"Familiar sounds tell me it's morning the night has been so dark and long
Each night without you just gets longer
While this torch I still carry just burns stronger
I know I never will stop loving you my tears just can't put out the flame
Or drown my hopes of your returning cause baby the fire's still burning
[ steel ]
Wherever you are I hope you're happy although your love for me has died
But if you ever need or want me I'll take you back any time
I know I never will stop...
Yes baby the fire's still burning"

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
I hear he's gone to some far country
And that he cares no more for me
I wish I were a swallow flying
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place
I'd join the wild birds in their crying
Thinking of you and your sweet face
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
But now the stars have turned against me
And he cares no more for me
Oh when the dark is on the mountain
And all the world has gone to sleep
I will go down to the cold dark waters
And there I'll lay me down and weep
Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me"

A young couple marries, already fighting
Along comes baby makin' them three
Trouble's all he hears from the time he's in didies
Baby don't know just what to believe
Angry words and spiteful actions
Baby's gonna cut his teeth on these
If that's gonna be the main attraction
What will the baby be, what will baby be
Baby needs love and needs direction
Baby's first school is the family
For they are only a reflection
Of the things they see, what will baby be
What will baby be after baby is grown
What will baby do if baby don't know what's right or wrong
Got to show them love, got to teach them truth
'Cause what baby is when baby grows up
Well, that depends entirely on me and you
Depends entirely on me and you
Baby thinks God is just a curse word
Never said a prayer 'cause he's never been taught
They remember and repeat what they've heard
So I ask who's really at fault
So many questions, so few answers
So many lessons we don't teach
Stumbling through like clumsy dancers
What will baby be, what will baby be
What will baby be after baby is grown
What will baby do when baby is out there on his own
Teach the children how to be all they should be
'Cause what baby is when baby grows up
Depends entirely on you and me
Depends entirely on you and me
What will baby be"

In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
My love, my love, what have I done
To make you treat me so
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
You've caused me to leave my home
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia Line
The engine passed at six o'clock
The caboose went by at nine
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo"
"It wasn't very long ago
We had a love few people know
And everything was going oh so fine
I trusted you, you trusted me
The way that it's supposed to be
But love slipped from us somewhere down the line
We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did, everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find
It's gone but we can't understand
How luck could slip right through our hands
All down the line things seemed so very right
The love we shared through all these years
We both knew that we were sincere
Then suddenly it left just overnight
We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did, everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find
Now that we've gone our separate ways
I still recall those brighter days
Days that didn't seem so very long
Neither of us ought to blame
We overly know that it's a shame
And all that we had going now is gone
We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did, everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find"
"I lie in bed beside you and watch you while you sleep
And wonder who I was before I loved you
Lying here beside you feeling so complete
Thinking how I love and need and trust you
Because I love you I'm a brand new person now because you love me
I can face the world and have the cause I love you
Because you love me because I love you
[ strings ]
Sweeter even still is knowing that you're lying there
And let you soon awake and reach to hold me
And anyway you want me that's the way that I am yours
Love as strong as this lets you control me
Because I love you...
Because I love you..."
"(Dolly Parton)
I used to sit for hours as a kid
Dangle my feet from an old flat bridge,
Seein' myself in the water below
Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw
I recall a vacant old shack
Down by the edge of the tobaccer patch
A child's reflection in a dirty window
Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
I'm far from perfect, but I ain't all bad;
It hurts me more than it makes me mad
You gather your stones by stoopin' so low
Then shatter my image with the stones you throw
If you live in a glass house, don't throw stones
Don't shatter my image 'til you look at your own
Look at your reflection in your house of glass
Don't open my closet if your own's full of trash
Stay out of my closet if your own's full of trash
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
Don't shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw"

There is no love and there is no hate there is no feeling at all
I look at you and you look at me but we might as well stare at the wall
Cause you don't see me and I don't see you just the shadow of love that is gone
There is no love and there is no hate no reason to hurry home
There's no tiny hands to reach out to us no plans bein' made anymore
We have no tomorrow our future is gone there is only sadness in store
We don't care enough to even ask questions
And when we're together we still feel alone
There is no love and there is no hate no reason to hurry home
There is nothing to look forward to no reason to hurry home"
"I want to tell you all a story 'bout a harper valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter that attended harper valley junior high
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said, ""mama, i've got a note here from the harper valley pta""
Well the note says ""mrs. johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
Now we don't believe you ought to be a bringin' up your little girl this way""
And it was signed by the secretary, harper valley pta
Well it happened that the pta was gonna meet that very afternoon
And boy, were they surprised as mrs. johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard i can still recall the word she had to say
She said ""i'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley pta
Now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
And mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And mr. baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down
Now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's bar again
And if you smell shirley thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think that i ain't fit
Well this is just a little payton place and you're all harper valley hypocrites"
"Satan's got river Satan's got river deep and wide so deep and wide
Satan's got a river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming he's got folks a swimming
In the warm smooth tire
But some day Satan's river
Yes some day Satan's river is gonna run dry it's gonna run dry
What was once a smooth river hot lava will make the tide
Stay clear of Satan's river heaven's on either side
Big yachts are sailing Satan's river so smooth
Never stopping or thinking about God's golden rule
When the river starts to sinking they'll cry I've been a fool
Satan's got river deep and wide
Satan's got river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming in the warm smooth tide"
"(Dolly Parton)
You oughta go north somebody told us
'Cause the air is filled with gold dust
And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands
Now I don't recall you said it
But we'd lived so long on credit
And so we headed out to find our promised land
Just poor Appalachian farm folk
With nothing more than high hopes
We hitched our station wagon to a star
But our dreams all fell in on us
'Cause there was no land of promise
And it's a stuggle keepin' sight of who you are
Oh and these northern nights are dreary
And my southern heart is weary
I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I'll keep leanin' on sweet Jesus
I know He'll love and guide and lead us
Appalachian memories keep me strong
Ya know I've been thinkin' a whole lot lately
About what's been and what awaits me
It takes all I've got to give what life demands
You go insane if you give in to it
Life's a mill and I've been through it
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands
Oh and these northern nights are dreary
And my southern eyes are teary
Don't I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus
I know he'll love and guide and lead us
Appalachian memories keep me strong
I'll keep lookin' to the Father
Keep our heads above the water
Appalachian memories keep me strong"
"Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us, never molested, though in the wrong
When death has come and taken our loved ones, it leaves our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper living so wicked year after year
Farther along we'll know all about it; farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother; live in the sunshine, we'll understand it all by and by
Faithful till death said our loving master; a few more days to labor and wait
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing as we sweep through the beautiful gates
Farther along we'll know all about it...
Yes, we'll understand it all by and by"
"If every time that you got hurt it left a scar
And if every dream you ever had broke your heart
If every time you made a plan the world came to an end
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
If broken dreams are all it seems you've ever known
And hurt's the only thing you can depend upon
And if you should find misery to be your only friend
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
If every time you look up a cloud should hide the sun
Pay dearly for each kindness ever shown to anyone
If everything you try should fail before you can begin
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again"
"Friends ask how I'll get along without you they say it's so sad we're apart
I have to agree that I don't seem like me I'm havin' a ball with my heart
Anything's better than nothing nothing's not too much to lose
Anything's better than nothing nothing's what I have with you
I've got to admit that it hurts me I don't like to fight or to fuss
But now you and me are just happy we're free and everyone's crying but us
Anything's better than nothing...
It really must be disappointment to see love and dream turn to smoke
I can't blame my friends when their teardrops begin
I once thought that love made a home
Anything's better than nothing...
Nothing's what I have with you..."
"(Dolly Parton)
Spent all my money on everyone else
Why I just kept handing it out right and left
They didn't appreciate none of my help
I have found
Had me a man
I was so much in love
But he just walked off after using me up
I cried like a baby
It hurt me so much and I'm down
Yeah, I'm sure down
I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up
I just need some time
Just need a little streak of good luck
And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am
You try to do right but tell me where does that get you
People just use you and then they forget you
Well it wont take me long
To get my feet back on solid ground
But now I'm down
When I get my life back in order again
Well I'll still be willing to help out my friends
And if you need some body or wished it had been, look around
I'll be spending my money on everyone else
Well I'll just be handing it out right and left
I'll find a new love i wont live by myself
I'm just down, now, yeah I'm down
I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up
I just need some time
Just need a little streak of good luck
And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am
You try to do right but tell me where does that get you
People just use you and then they forget you
Well it wont take me long
To get my feet back on solid ground
But now I'm down
I know that I'm down
But I'm bound to get up"
"Love is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
I feel it when you're with me
It happens when you kiss me
That rare and gentle feeling that I feel inside
Your touch is soft and gentle
Your kiss is warm and tender
Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies
Love is like a butterfly
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
Your laughter brings me sunshine
Everyday is spring time
And I am only happy when you are by my side
How precious is this love we share
How very precious, sweet and rare
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies
Love is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing"
"(Dolly Parton)
Hello you said the day we met
Handing me a yellow rose
You asked me out
And to your surprise
And to mine I said I'd go
I thought it so romantic
And I found you sweet and bold
Though we'd only met
I still said yes
To a single yellow rose
And for years to come
You were the one
To sleep with me at night
To laugh and talk
And share my thoughts
And hold me when I'd cry
And on every occasion
And for no good reason to
A big bouquet or a single yellow rose
Was sent from you
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so
I never see a yellow rose
That I didn't think of you
It's still my favorite flower
Though the yellow's turned to blue
The day you left my teardrops fell
Upon your farewell not
You said goodbye like you said hello
With a single yellow rose
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
Oh I still love you so
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Sweet yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so"
"You never close your eyes anymore
When I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness
Like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it, baby
But baby, baby
I know it
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa...
Now there's no welcome look
In your eyes when I reach for you
And now you're starting to
Criticize little things I do
It makes me just feel like crying, baby
'Cause baby,
Something beautiful is dying
You lost that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa
Baby, baby,
I get down on my knees
And pray to you
If you would only love me
Like you used to do
We had a love, a love,
A love you don't find everyday
So don't, don't, don't
Don't let it slip away
Bring back that lovin' feeling
Oh, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on, whoa...
You've lost the lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost the lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Bring back that lovin' feeling,
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone"
"(Dolly Parton)
Take my hand and run with me
Out of the past of yesterday
And walk with me into the future of tomorrow
Yesterday must be forgot
No looking back no matter what
There's nothing there but mem'ries that bring sorrow
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever
No more crying tears leave tracks
And mem'ries find their way back
Tomorrow's waiting let's journey there together
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever
I care not for yesterday I love you as you are today
Yesterday just helped to pass the time while waiting
We must forget the passing time
My love for you is the real kind
The kind that won't hurt you, oh never
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever"
"We're well known in every honky tonk in town
Not a night goes by that we don't make the rounds
People wonder why we choose to live this way
Why don't they ever stay at home I hear them say
But home is where the hurt is
Cause love doesn't live there anymore
Home is where the hurt is
That's why we don't stay at home much anymore
[ fiddle ]
What was once our happy home has come to be
A place to fuss and fight and disagree
Our lonely house with wall to wall regret
And these bright lights somehow help us to forget
Cause home is where the hurt is...
That's why we don't stay at home much anymore"
"Two people, together
It was just a dream until you came along
My heart was waiting just for you
Tomorrow, forever
We both heard these promises for far too long
And now you make the words come true
So touch me now
I need to have you close tonight
And show me how
You can me feel this way
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key
Can't keep it, a secret
Everything I feel is written on my face
I can't hide my heart from you
You hold me, is magic
In your arms the world becomes a better place
Now I know what love can do
Here we go
Exactly where the road will lead us
I don't know
I just know that you'll be there
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key
And whenever you, I'm there
Every stumble and fall, I share
I'll be yours through it all
Coz I care, about you baby
It's so easy to see, so strong
Now I know you and me, belong
I'll be by your side forever....
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key"
"Last night, my tears they were fallin'
I went to bed so sad and blue
Then I had a dream of you
I dreamed I was strollin' in the evenin'
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinkin' about you
And then you met me in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there too
I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her, you looked at me
I wondered who you were talkin' to
I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking more inside
'Cause I was still wonderin' who
Your arm was restin' on her shoulder
You smiled at her, she smiled at you
Her eyes were filled with victory
She said my brother wants to marry
And then my heart was filled with ease
I knew that you would marry me
Oh, I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her, you looked at me
I knew that you would marry me
I don't believe you've met my baby"
"(Dolly Parton)
Backstory:
Tabloid prediction: Dolly Parton will announce she's falling madly in love with a 300 pound professional wrestler. She'll write a song about their relationship titled ""Headlock on My Heart"" and feature her massive muscleman in the video.
Dolly: Now this actually came out in this magazine. Now, you folks I'm sure buy these every week at the supermarket, right? And you know they never put anything in these magazines that's not true, right? So I figured since I was gonna fall in love anyhow, why wait? So I went out and I found me a 300 pound wrestler and I sat down and I wrote a song called ""Headlock on My Heart"" and I did a video. As a matter of fact, in the same magazine on a page opposite, there was a picture of Hulk Hogan. Now, I love Hulk Hogan. My Daddy's crazy about him, so I called Hulk, I said ""Would you do this?"" 'Cause the song is a fantasy, and it's about a guy named Starlight Starbright. He said ""Aw sure, I'd do anything with you, Dolly!"" I said ""Well, thanks, Hulk, I ought to hug your neck!"" So wouldn't that be something if me and Hulk really wound up getting married? Watch this video...
Song:
The first time that I saw him
Was in a wrestling magazine.
Then I watched him on TV,
Then I bought a ringside seat.
His name was Starlight Starbright,
The greatest in the land.
He sprinkled stardust in my eyes
I was his biggest fan.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Referee: 300 pounds of magic right here in the ring tonight.
Starlight Starbright: Wrestling fans, big and small, who's the greatest of them all?
Dolly: Starlight! Starlight Starbright! Starlight! Starlight Starbright!
He dazzled 'em with brilliance,
He outshined all the rest.
And I loved the heart that beat
Beneath his massive golden chest.
Spoken:
Dolly: In this ring, I thee wed.
Referee: Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
Starlight Starbright: I do!
Referee: And do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
Dolly: I do, I truly do!
Referee: I now pronounce you man and wife.
Dolly: Uh, you may now kiss the bride.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Dolly: Well, it's a whole new arena for me,
But it's a whole new wrestling match for him.
I guess you could say he pinned me down for a lifetime.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart."

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some missletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with eyes all aglow
Who find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-four
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you"
"Now Little Will was from the hills way back in the sticks
He got his reputation from turning on them country chicks
He drove a souped up hot rod car buddy he could really
Knock those little girls off their feet yeah
Hillbilly Willy
He'd talk that ole sweet lovers talk with a hillbilly drawl
Willy wasn't much for looks he was only five feet tall
But when he talked that ole sweet talk he drove those little girls silly
They stood in line waiting for their time to court
Hillbilly Willy
Then this country cyclops who measured six foot nine
Came up to Little Will and said, ""You stole that little girl of mine""
Then there was a awful brawl boy it was a dilly
When the fighting stopped there on top stood
Hillbilly Willy
Now the moral of the story is to be a lover you gotta be tough
Even if you're just five feet tall you gotta be able to strut your stuff
Now to all you lovers in radioland, if your love life's a little chilly
Bear in mind the rough, tough kind like
Hillbilly Willy
Just bear in mind the rough, tough kind like
Hillbilly Willy"
"It wasn't very long ago
We had a love few people know
And everything was going oh so fine
I trusted you, you trusted me
The way that it's supposed to be
But love slipped from us somewhere down the line
We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did, everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find
It's gone but we can't understand
How luck could slip right through our hands
All down the line things seemed so very right
The love we shared through all these years
We both knew that we were sincere
Then suddenly it left just overnight
We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did, everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find
Now that we've gone our separate ways
I still recall those brighter days
Days that didn't seem so very long
Neither of us ought to blame
We overly know that it's a shame
And all that we had going now is gone
We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did, everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find"
"Two sides to every story we can't stay this out if we'll take time
Two sides to every story you tell yours and I tell mine
Well where were you last night when I came home
When I came in you were out and gone
Well I waited up till up to two then I went downtown to look for you
So how's about tellin' me where you were at
Well me and the boys stopped off for a drink or two
(Now ain't you a pretty thing)
Well we got to drinkin' and I guess that time just flew
Well the time must've flown for you alright
Cause I thought you're gonna stay out all night
And I told myself I ain't a puttin' up to that
There's always two sides to every story...
You said you went downtown to look for me
Did you have to dress up fancy as could be
You know I never leave the house you know jacky clothes lookin' like slut
And I's downtown just to look in my best for you
Now I'm not accusin' you of doin' wrong
But that's awful late for you to be out and gone
Now look who's talkin' bout bein' late and I wasn't about to sit and wait
Why you were at that when with no tellin' who"
"You never cease to amaze me
You can still make me crazy
Baby you can turn me on with just your eyes
You're just so darn appealing
Ooh, you stir up sexy feelings
Every man in the room would love to try you on for size
Baby ,wait 'til I get you home
Wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home, sweet baby
Wait 'til I get you home

"You and I have been together for a long long time
And we vowed that we would stay together always
Life at times has been unpleasant down the trails where fate had led us
But we pray that God will let us be together always
Together together together always you and me
Forever and ever together always you and me
[ piano ]
Throught the years our love will multiply and be divided
By the children added to enrich our lives
God's been good to you and I and in heaven there's eternal life
Beyond this world where you and I will be together always
Together together...
Together together..."
"Where you live you say the view is so beautiful
And the astroturf that's on your lawn stays green the whole year around
And the buildings are so tall they almost reach heaven
But do you ever ever hear the robins sing
Do you hear the robins singing in the springtime
While a mockingbird sings his happy song
Is all the beauty in your world this artificial thing
Do you ever ever hear the robins sing
[ ac.guitar ]
Where I live the butterflies still kiss the roses
And forgetmenots still grow along the shady lane
And the weeping willow trees still swaying in the breeze
And often I still hear the robins sing
Do you hear the robins...
Do you ever ever hear the robins sing"
"Give me a word

I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open, I leave on a light
I'm always waiting in case you drop by
I'll never say goodbye
People have told me you have a new love
My heart's not willing to give up on us
I've convinced myself they're just telling me lies
And I'll never say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open, I leave on a light
I never wanted you out of my life
And I'll never say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye

And I'll never say goodbye

I'll never say goodbye, no, I'll never say goodbye"

Oh, the pain of loving you
Oh, the misery I go through
Never knowing what to do
Oh, the pain of loving you
You just can't stand to see me happy
Seems you hurt me all you can
Still I go on loving you
But I never understand
To love and hate at the same time
The line between the two is fine
The two have bound me heart and soul
So strong that I can't let you go"
"As I sit here tonight, the jukebox playin'
The tune about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words you are sayin'
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men
Think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start
Most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men
Think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong"

At last I have called up with you and you're a sight to see
Could this really be my outlaw lover JJ Sneed
Could a woman with a painted face and pretty sweet disguise
Turn your heart against me with her evil cunning eyes her evil cunning eyes
JJ it's been you and me right from the very start
And ever job we ever pulled I'd always done my part
We'd really stick together until the bitter end
And it was my understanding we were whole lots more than friends
A whole lot more than friends
And it was me that kept you on when nights were dark and cold
But I guess I didn't look like much in these old ragged clothes
But you said it didn't matter cause you love me that a way
You said that no one else could ever steal your heart away steal your heart away
Do you recall the Union Bank we robbed in Franklin Town
And as we made our getaway the sheriff gunned you down
And I doctored up your bullet wounds and nursed you while you sit
But now you have betrayed me is that the thanks I get is that the thanks I get
Oh yeah JJ I'm thinking now of how we'd all begun
Of all the times we've robbed and killed with our trust wordy gun
Why we stood off a fuss it was JJ just you and I
But now you have betrayed me and for that you're gonna die
Yeah for that you're gonna die
The good old days are over as we stand here in the rain
JJ I'm gonna shoot you now I hope you'll feel no pain
I hear whoopees of the horses and fieces on my trail
I guess I'll join you soon but for now JJ farewell for now JJ farewell"
"I thought I'd been in love before but so did you
I thought that I would love no more but so did you
We'll always be together forever yours forever mine
You and me you and me are two of a kind
There's so much between you and me like sadness disappointment jealousy
Like respect and honor and admiration and a love so fine
You and me you and me are two of a kind
I've made promises to you that I couldn't keep
And you know I've said things to you that I didn't mean
We've made our vows and we can never break the ties that bind
You and me you and me are two of a kind
There's so much between you and me..."

When my back was turned she took him away
Now while they're all outside, waiting to throw rice
What I want to throw will surely black her eyes
Cause I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad
Well I never stole nothin' in my life
But if I get the chance I'll steal him from his wife
Cause all is fair in love and war, maybe I'm carryin' this too far
But I feel like tying dynamite to her side of the car
No I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad"
"In silver sandals she goes walking up those golden stairs
And though we miss her so we know she's happy to be there
She walks with us in memory we see her all the time
In silver sandals walking through our minds
So many times we let our thoughts turn back to yesterday
To a little girl that could only watch the children as they played
She walks with us in memories we see her all the time
In silver sandals walking through our minds
The grave in which she sleeps is cold but our thoughts of her are warm
And we cry as we both long to hold her in our arms
Each night in dreams we see her running to us smiling sweet
With silver sandals on her little feet
In silver sandals she goes walking...
She had asked for sandals from the time that she could talk
And it would break our hearts when she'd ask us why she couldn't walk
She'd say when I go to heaven can I change my crutches then
For a pair of silver sandals at the rainbow's end
In silver sandals she goes walking...
In silver sandals walkin' through our minds"
"(Dolly Parton)
Beauty is a rare perfume
Precious, yet doesn't last long
Youth is but a playful breeze
That blows our way once then moves on
Love is a hidden treasure
Some never find where it lies
And memory is a little bird
Flies through life, live or dies
Little bird
Take me aboard your beautiful wings and let me fly
Fly me away back to yesterday
And drop me off there awhile
Let me smell the rare perfume of the sweet flower of beauty again
Let me run in the playful breeze of youth long gone with the wind
Let me sit for awhile by the place where I found the treasure of love
Then sing me a song as you fly me along on our long last journey above"
"We're holding on to nothing left to hold onto
I'm so tired of holding on to nothin'
The years have shown no kindness
For the hard times we've been through
We've squeezed the life from every dream
And still go right on bluffin'
With really nothin' left to hold onto
Oh, why do we keep holding on
With nothing left to hold onto
Let's be honest with each other
That's the least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto
We were young and foolishly mistaken
Victims of a passion, much too strong to be denied
With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'
God only knows how long, how hard we've tried
Oh, why do we keep holding on
With nothing left to hold onto
Let's be honest with each other
That's the least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto"
"As time goes by the tales grow taller about possum in Possum Holler
As a young man I'd go a courtin' with my sweetheart so young and fair
Down the mountain to Possum Holler that's where he'd always find me waitin' there
Now I tell my mama that I's goin' out walkin' neath the moonlight so bright and fair
And I'd tell daddy I was huntin' possum
And take off a grinnin' and a slickin' down my hair
As time goes by the tales grow taller about possum in Possum Holler
Then one evening in Possum Holler my sweetheart's daddy stopped all our fun
Yeah we got married in Possum Holler just you and me my daddy and daddy's gun
As time goes by the tales grow taller about possum in Possum Holler
Now when they see a possum hunter young and handsome and a smellin' fair
We just lean back and bust our laughin' cause we know there ain't no possum there
As time goes by the tales grow taller about possum in Possum Holler
About possum in Possum Holler"
"There must be something fishy going on
You said you were goin' on a fishin' trip with some old friend
You said that you'd be home tonight somewhere around ten
Well here it is, it's two o'clock and you're still not at home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
I think that I'm a sucker that's swallowing your line
I try to make myself believe that it's all in my mind
But you never asked me if I'd like to go along
So there must be something fishy goin' on
There's something fishy goin' on
On these fishin' trips you're goin' on
I'm gettin' tired of stayin' home alone
Some night when you come home and discover that I'm gone
You can bet there's something fishy goin' on
I guess some large-mouth bass left that lipstick on your shirt
I don't think you're a fisherman, honey
I think you're a flirt
Well if you're goin' fishin' then why don't you bring 'em home
I think there's something fishy goin' on
There's something fishy goin' on
On these fishin' trips you're goin' on
I'm gettin' tired of stayin' home alone
Yes, you can bet there's something fishy goin' on"

"(A wish that Malena had wings)
Malena for hours would run in the meadow
Well Malena would go to play every day
She chased butterflies and she'd say with the smile
If I had wings I could fly that away
Malena would cry when we try to explain
That little girl's world's supposed to have wings
That only in heaven can little girls fly
We'd see a strange look in Malena's eyes
(A wish that Malena had wings)
We'll always remember Malena's last birthday
Boxes with bright colored ribbon and string
And the wish that she made as she blew out the candles
A wish that Malena had wings
And with all the gifts that we bought for Malena
The wish that she made we could not satisfy
But on the night of her birthday the angels fullfilled it
They gave her wings and now Malena can fly"
"(Dolly Parton)
I try hard to forget you and the love I once shared with you
But my mind won't let forgetfulness come in
There's no use in pretending. The hurt is just beginning
Just when I think it's ending you're on my mind again
On my mind again, just like you've always been
On my mind with memories I'm rememberin'
On my mind again, just like you've always been
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again
Sometimes I go to places where certain things erases
All traces of your memory, now and then
Oh, then something will remind me of the love I left behind me
Then again, your memory finds me and you're on my mind again
On my mind again, just like you've always been
On my mind with memories I'm rememberin'
On my mind again, just like you've always been
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again
On my mind again"
"Train, train
Gonna take him on out of this town
Train, train
Gonna take him on out of this town
Yeah, that man I'm in love with
Lord, he's Memphis bound
He's leavin' here

"I want to tell you all a story 'bout a harper valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter that attended harper valley junior high
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said, ""mama, i've got a note here from the harper valley pta""
Well the note says ""mrs. johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
Now we don't believe you ought to be a bringin' up your little girl this way""
And it was signed by the secretary, harper valley pta
Well it happened that the pta was gonna meet that very afternoon
And boy, were they surprised as mrs. johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard i can still recall the word she had to say
She said ""i'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley pta
Now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
And mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And mr. baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down
Now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's bar again
And if you smell shirley thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think that i ain't fit
Well this is just a little payton place and you're all harper valley hypocrites"
"(Dolly Parton)
I look at you and I see something special
I feel something special, something that's rare
If you feel the same way when you're lookin' at me
I know there could be a love we could share
Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the things that we need
Won't you come and love with me
We'll sing us a love song the songbirds would envy
A song that the angels would be proud to sing
We'll say with our hearts what no poet could capture
Say with our eyes what no artist could paint
Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the love that we need
Won't you come and love with me"
"I was so excited when you asked if I could go
But mom said I'd have to ask my daddy
I met him at the front door so afraid that he'd say no
But he smiled and said, ""Let mama get you ready.""
In your cotton shirt and faded jeans, you came for me
And the gingham dress was all I had to wear
With a dollar in your pocket and a borrowed car
You picked a yellow daisy for my hair
That's the way it could have been
Oh, that's the way it should have been
If I had met you way back then
That's the way it would have been
I put away my gingham for a pretty dress of white
And you wore a suit instead of faded jeans
Our wedding day was perfect and we loved away the night
Life for us was filled with lots of dreams
We bought a house upon a hill outside of town
And two young people finally settled in
And you just won't believe the little children running 'round
And they pick yellow daisies now and then
And that's the way it could have been
Oh, that's the way it should have been
If I had met you way back then
That's the way it would have been
That's the way it could have been"
"Oooh,OOh,Oooh-ooh,Oh,Oh,Oh,Oh-oh-oh-oh.
Well, I can't tell you where I'm going
I'm not sure of where I've been
But I know I must keep travelin'
Till my road comes to an end
I'm out here on my journey
Trying to make the most of it
I'm a puzzle I must figure out
Where all my pieces fit
Chorus
Like a poor wayfairing stranger
That they speak about in song
I'm just a weary pilgrim
Trying to find what feels like home
Well, that is no one can tell me
Am I doomed to ever roam
I'm just travelin' travelin' travelin'
I'm just travelin' on.
Questions I have many
Ansewers but a few
We're here to learn the spirit burns
To learn the greater truth
We've all been crusified
And they nailed Jesus to the tree
And when I'm born again
You're gonna see a change in me
God made me for a reason
And nothing is in vain
Redemption comes in many shapes
With many kinds of pain
Oh, sweet Jesus if you're out there
Keep me ever close to you
As I'm stumbling tumbling
As I'm traveling through
I'm just traveling traveling traveling.
I'm just traveling through ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
I'm just traveling traveling
I'm just traveling through ooho ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Oh sometimes the road gets rugged
And it's hard to travelin' on
But hold in to each other
We don't have to work alone
When everything is broken
We can mend it if we try
We can make the world a difference
If we want to we can fllly.
Good-bye you little children
Good-night you handsome men
Farewell to all you ladies
And to all who knew me when...
And I hope I'll see ya down the road
You meant more than I knew
As I'm travelin' travelin' travelin' travelin' travelin' through
Drifting like a floating boat
And roaming like the wind
Oh give me some direction lord
Let me lean on you
As I'm travelin' travelin' through (Repeat, Repeat)
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like the poor wayfaring stranger
That they speak about in song
I'm just like a weary pilgrim
Tryin' to find my own way home
Oh, sweet jesus if you're out there
Keep me ever close to you
As I'm travelin' travelin' travelin' through
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh travelin' through."
"As blue skies and daylight darken into night
Surrounding us with beauty as the stars make their light
They spell out our names all the stars up above
As they flicker and shine like letters of love
Then a warm breath of air whispers through the trees
As the leaves on their branches have blown to the breeze
Ripples of water seemed to echo the sound
Love's out tonight there's love all around
Small drops of dew act as nature's perfume
Placing its fragrance on all that's in blue
While I hold you so close your lips touching mine
With nature all around us watching our love entwine
Love's out tonight see the candles in the sky
God lend us the heavens tonight for you and I
A night full of love for all the world to see
Love's out tonight all around you and me
Love's out tonight"
"To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven
A time to be born, a time to die
A time to plant, a time to reap
A time to kill, a time to heal
A time to laugh, a time to weep
To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven
A time to build up, a time to break down
A time to dance, a time to mourn
A time to cast away stones
A time to gather stones together
To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven
A time of love, a time of hate
A time of war, a time of peace
A time you may embrace
A time to refrain from embracings
A time to gain, a time to lose
A time to rend, a time to sew
A time to love, a time to hate
A time of peace, I swear it's not too late"
"(Dolly Parton)
Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear me, are you listenin' any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speakin' terms
Can you help me like before?
I have questioned your existence,
My resistance leaves me cold
Can you help me go the distance?
Hello God, hello, hello
This old world has gone to pieces
Can we fix it, is there time?
Hate and violence just increases
We're so selfish, cruel and blind
We fight and kill each other
In your name, defending you
Do you love some more than others?
We're so lost and confused
Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear us, are you listenin' any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speakin' terms
Can you help us like before?
Oh, the free will you have given
We have made a mockery of
This is no way to be livin',
We're in great need of your love
Hello God
Hello God, can you grant us
Love enough to make amends
(Hello God) Is there still a chance
That we could start again
Hello God, we've learned our lesson
Dear God, don't let us go
More than ever
Hello God, hello, hello
Hello God, we really need you
We can't make it without you
(Hello God) We beseech you
In the name of all that's true
Hello God, please forgive us
For we know not what we do
Hello God, give us one more chance to prove ourselves to you
Hello, God; hello, God"

"I can see you're disappointed
By the way you look at me
And I'm sorry that I'm not
The woman you thought I'd be
Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman
So when you look at me
Don't feel sorry for yourself
Just think of all the shame
You might have brought somebody else
Just let me tell you this
Then we'll both know where we stand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman
Now a man will take a good girl
And he'll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
Well, that's a different situation
He'll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band
Now I know that I'm no angel
If that's what you thought you'd found
I was just the victim of
A man that let me down
Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman
No, my mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman"
"(Buck Ram)
Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell
Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I've played the game but to my real shame
You've left me to dream all alone
Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal
Oh yes I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearin' my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around
Too real is the feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal
Oh yes I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearin' this old heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around
But I know what I am
I am the great pretender"
"Their thoughts're all mingled their dreams all confused
Their minds and their bodies how they abuse
Searching for answers that doesn't grow there
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower
Their plans their desires and all of their hopes
Wither and die as they go up in smoke
Sharp as a needle and filled with despair
Such is the curse of the wild weed flower
From a moment of joy to a lifetime of sorrow
For one day of pleasure they trade their tomorrows
Lost in a garden where bulbs all grow
With blossoms of heartaches and petals of woe
Eyes full of emptiness just stand and stare
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower"
"Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him two lips like roses and clover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Sandman, I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic brean
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him the word that I'm not a rover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace
Mister Sandman, someone to hold
Would be so peachy before we're too old
Sp please turn on your magic beam
Mister Sandman, bring us
Please, please, please
Mister Sandman, bring us a dream"

I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you
Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name
Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me
Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me
Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do
Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can

"GOOD UNDERSTANDING
Duet by Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner
Writer Dolly Parton
Copyright 1970
When we married we agreed that we'd both do as we please
Just as long as we done each other right
Through the years our love has grown now our love is twice as strong
Cause we've got a good understanding
Yes we've got a good understanding and a love that has never been demanding
We both love each other so and that's all we need to know
Cause we've got a good understanding
It's been your unselfish love that has always helped me up
When temptation reached out its hand to see
And when I could have gone wrong I would think of you at home
And I'd think about our good understanding
Yes we've got a good understanding..."
"Satan's got river Satan's got river deep and wide so deep and wide
Satan's got a river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming he's got folks a swimming
In the warm smooth tire
But some day Satan's river
Yes some day Satan's river is gonna run dry it's gonna run dry
What was once a smooth river hot lava will make the tide
Stay clear of Satan's river heaven's on either side
Big yachts are sailing Satan's river so smooth
Never stopping or thinking about God's golden rule
When the river starts to sinking they'll cry I've been a fool
Satan's got river deep and wide
Satan's got river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming in the warm smooth tide"

Your trembling hands held me near
Your soft warm lips whispered in my ear
You said you'd always love me
And we'd always be together
And you promised me your love would last forever
Is forever longer than always?
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always?"

(I'll remember you forever I'll remember you as mine)
Let's pretend tonight that it's the same as always
Let's go back just the little ways in time
Let's fill this one last night with lasting mem'ries
Let's me remember you as mine
Hold me close pretending it's still me and you love
And let me be the only thought that's on your mind
Let's pretend that you don't really have a new love
Oh no let me remember you as mine
I remember you as sunshine that gave lights to my world
I remember you as gentle as this night
I remember you as heaven that let me hold a little while
I remember you whether I remember you as mine
When you leave my arms then I will be alone love
Hold me close love me gently one last time
I won't ever picture you with no one else love no I remember you as mine
I remember you as sunshine...
As mine as mine"
"I'm to the point where it don't add up
I can't say I've come this far
With my guitar on pure dumb luck
That's not to say, I know it all
'Cause every time I get too high up
On my horse I fall
'Cause I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I need, Jesus & gravity
But I'm as bad as anyone
Takin' all these blessings in my life
For granted one by one
When I start to think and it's all me
Well, something comes along
And knocks me right back on my knees and
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I need, Jesus & gravity
He's my friend, He's my light
He's my wings, He's my flight
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I'm gonna need
I've got Jesus, I got Jesus
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I'll ever need
'Cause I've got Jesus & gravity
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I need
'Cause I've got Jesus & gravity
Jesus, I got Jesus, I've got Jesus
He's my only friend
He lifts me up, He give me wings
He gives me hope
And He gives me strength
And that's all I'll ever need
As long as He keeps lifting me
He is my light, He is my guide
He is my wings, He is my flight
Lift me, I've got Jesus
I've got Jesus and that's all I need"
"(Blaise Tosti/Bud Reneau)
Though the sun may be dawning
You're the one that lights the morning
As I awake to the heaven
Of your sweet summer lovin'
By a stream in the country
Running barefoot and feeling free
While the love in our hearts blend
Into sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin' in the dandelions
Sweet summer lovin' keeps me high as candy wine
When that big red balloon sets
Like a painting across the West
As the sky turns a crimson blue
As the world turns for me and you
By the light of the moon glowing
While the warm summer wind blows
'Cross the sill of your window
We'll be letting our love flow
Sweet summer lovin' in the dandelions
Sweet summer lovin' keeps me high as candy wine
Sweet summer lovin' in the dandelions
Sweet summer lovin' keeps me high as candy wine
Sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin'
I love your sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin'
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin'
Mmm...
Sweet summer lovin'"
"Mendy is sixteen and uncontrolable Mendy is only a child
Mendy is in with the in-crowd Mendy is ever so wild
Mendy's hair hangs straight and long Mendy feels this is a must
Mini skirts and many friends and many heartaches for us
Mendy finds a plenty to do but Mendy never sleeps
Mendy slips out of the house in the evening when the sun is sinking
Mendy is out with the in-crowd Mendy is smoking and drinking
There's a different shine in Mendy's eyes
And the color is gone from her cheeks
Mendy is a swinger but Mendy never sleeps
Mendy never sleeps and Mendy is growing weak
Mendy lies lifeless and limp in our arms now....
Oh Mendy please don't go to sleep"
"(Dolly Parton)
Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady
I was happy with my baby, I was such a lucky lady
Hey, lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady
Lucky lady, that's what I was, I was lucky to have his love
All a woman could wish for, he was that and so much more
He was mine and how I loved him before your hands ever touched him
Long before your temping eyes lured my baby from my life
Hey, hey, Lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady
Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady
I was happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady
Is it love or is it pleasure, do you know you've found a treasure
Are you only having fun, do you know the prize you've won?
If you don't want something lasting, if it's just the time you're passing
Lucky lady, give him up 'cause I do love him very much
Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady
I was happy with my baby, I was such a lucky lady
Hey, lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady
Hey, hey, Lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady"
"FIGHT AND SCRATCH
Duet by Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner
Copyright 1970
Fight and scratch fight and scratch that's all we ever do
There surely must be more to love than to fight and scratch with you
You you to fight and scratch with you
Well you just bought a foal last month now you want a wig
It looks like you couldn't understand my paycheck ain't that big
Well what about the dough you lose in them poker games downtown
I figured you'd mention that smart aleck
Yeah and that brand new boat and that fishin' gear
But no uhhuh I don't reckon that'd count really
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Sometimes I swear I think that you're the devil in disguise
Cause when you're mad you oughta see the fire fly from your eyes
Well you don't look so cute yourself when you're mad at me
And if you don't like the way I look then you know how to leave Bossy Catfish
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Well I love you and you love me but we're always findin' fault
But the way we fight you wouldn't know that we had any love at all
We just fight like cats and dogs we'll leave then come right back
For what excitement would we have if we didn't fight and scratch
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Why don't you drop dead oh you'd like me to and I'll live forever just for spite
Why don't you keep your big mouth shot
Well why don't you just make me if you think you're big enough
Yeah and I could whip you with both hands tied behind
Yeah you just try it with me and I'll knock your brains out
With a stick of soap that's good Catfish
What's a catfish why'd you call me that
They're all mouth and no brains boy that's really good
It's all I can do to keep from laughin' hah
That's funny you sure are a fynny little fellow"
"It's just a little bitty pissant country place
Ain't nothin' much to see
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatin' old time country place
Ain't nothing too high tone
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
But there's nothing dirty going on
Nothing dirty going on
We get simple farmers, local business men
Congress folks from Austin, young boys looking for sin
Now we used to get a lot of rough necks, when the oil boom was high
By pay day id get a little rowdy, thank God the field ran dry
[Chorus:]
It's just a little bitty pissant country place, nothing much to see
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatin old time country place, nothing too high tone
Just lots of good will, and maybe one small thrill, but there's nothing dirty going on
I don't hire no married girl, they're not on the ball
They got homes and husbands, they're not stable at all
You know they don't understand a thing about a proper business day
Now what's the point in opening up the store if you give the goods away
[Chorus]
Keep your language clean girls, keep your bedrooms neat
And don't hang around the town cafe and say hi on the street
Mind you P's and Q's and manners, and you don't need no other tools
Cause every girl that lives here knows my special no-no rules
Yea every girl that lives here knows Miss Mona's no-no rules
Ruby, Ray start em!
Beds are not to be wallowed in
That's the kind of thing that big fat lazy hogs do
And it don't make money!
Betrix!
I won't tolerate no tying up my telephone with other people's business
Eloise honey!
And please don't show us no tattoos
No hearts and flowers on your thigh
It's downright tacky
Brands for the cattle and that ain't what we're selling at Miss Mona's
Do you catch my drift?
I pay the food and the rent and the utilities
You keep your mind on your work responsibilities
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
And we can get along
Dawn!
Any bad habits you come in with, get rid off right now
Tatty Joe!
I can't stand no chewing gum it looks just like a cow
Lindy Lue!
Any one taking sick leave better be real sure they're sick
And every time you hear that bell...
You better get here double quick
And as for pimps
Pimps are something you don't need
To get your daily business done
Are you listening, girls?
Keep them leaches and blood suckers off the back roads,
I know how to use a gun
And nobody messes with my girls
And any questions you might have about the way I run this place
Don't grip and whine behind my back
Just tell me face to face, I'm open-minded, say it all
Then go upstairs and pack, the door's that a-way
She pays the food and the rent and the utilities
We keep our mind on our work responsibilities
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
And we can get along
[Chorus]
It's just a little bitty pissant country place, nothing much to see
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatin no time country place, nothing to hide at all
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
But there's nothing dirty going on
Nothing dirty going on"
"(E. Kaz)
Of all the roads I've traveled and all the sights I've seen
The most amazing thing is the power of our dreams
And anything is possible for those who can believe
Just get your heart to rearrange its priorities
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
It takes faith in one another to see things eye to eye
And it's hard to trust but you know it's worth the try
There's a candle in my window and whenever you feel blue
You can bet your bottom dollar I'll be there for you
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little bit harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
Oh I do believe in miracles
But I know they don't come easy
So why don't we give destiny
A helping hand
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little bit harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
Life is just too beautiful
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work"
"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you,
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling ""Yoo hoo,""
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
Let's go, Let's look at the show,
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
It's grand, Just holding your hand,
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land.
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you."
"(Dolly Parton)
We sang a love song the day that we met
You thought that we made the perfect duet
You liked my performance so you wanted to know
If I would stay on as the star of the show
And beautiful music we made for a time 'til she changed our tune
And you added new lines
Our duet arrangement became a trio
Now you want a star, but I just think you should know
I don't play second fiddle in nobody's band
And I'm no back-up singer and I won't be a fan
And I'm nobody's co-star
I just play leading rolls
And I don't want the part, don't want a part
Won't play a part unless it's star of the show
Oh, she's stealing the show that's been so dear to my heart
She's changing our song 'til I'm not sure of my part
She sharing the spotlight and there's not room for both
Now one or the other is the star of the show, the other goes
Life is a show and the show will go on
The world is stage, loves an act we perform
There's always some new act somewhere up the road
And I'll always be staring in somebodies' show
I don't play second fiddle in nobody's band
And I'm no back-up singer and I won't be a fan
And I'm nobody's co-star
I just play leading rolls
And I don't want the part, don't want a part
Won't play a part unless it's star of the show
I don't play second fiddle in nobody's band
And I'm no back-up singer and I won't be a fan
And I'm nobody's co-star
I just play leading rolls
And I don't want the part, don't want a part
Won't play a part unless it's star of the show
If I don't star in your show
Well I'm still a star and I can still go
You know I got to be, I got to be the star of the show"
"Can't say we're lovers, can't say we're friends
Don't even know if I'll see you again
But against your warm body I felt so alive
And you got me over a heartache tonight
My heart was broken, my hurt was deep
I had lost something I wanted to keep
Lookin' for comfort when you caught my eye
And you got me over a heartache tonight
Chorus:
Sweet conversation, a drink and a dance
Led to an evening of making romance
And I don't even care if it's wrong or it's right
'cause you got me over a heartache tonight
2nd chorus:
Yes, you got me over a heartache tonight
Stirring up passion brought me back to life
Oh, and it may not last, but who know it just might
But you got me over a heartache tonight
Yes, you got me over a heartache tonight"
"(Dolly Parton)
There's a place in my mind that's suspended in time
When we were happy in love
Days warm and sweet, and the night so complete
Then life was perfect for us
It was just you and I, only love in our eyes
Not a sign of a tear on our face
No sorrow, no pain, only sunshine, no rain
Before something else took its place
Oh, I wanna go back there
Back to the time there was no doubt you cared
Back to the time love was tender and fair
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Do you think if we tried we could put life aside
And see if we might make it back
I know in my heart what we had at the start
I believe it could still be like that
Oh, I wanna go back there
Away from these heartaches, these worried and cares
Back to the time love was tender and fair
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there (say you care)
I wanna go back, I wanna go back
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there"
"(Dolly Parton)
Randy in your eyes, I see the promise of a future
The promise of a love like I have never known
Randy, cradled in your arms, I feel like I'm in heaven
And heaven knows I've needed someone like you for so long
So Randy take me with you, for that's where I want to be
Teach me how to fly on these new wings you've given me
Randy, let me show you what your love has meant to me
Randy, let me be the only one you'll ever need
Randy, you have given me reason to live again
Reason to love again and reason to smile
Randy, you have given me new inspiration
New dreams to dream and a reason to try
So Randy take me with you for that's where I want to be
Teach me how to fly on these new wings you've given me
Randy, let me show you what your love has meant to me
Randy, let me be the only one you'll ever need"
"(Dolly Parton)
Sometimes he gets crazy as men are known to do
He'll lose his head in spite of everything he stands to lose
What is it in a man that makes him act like such a fool
She swears she never knew but always needed to
But stubborn pride is just the way of cowboys I suppose
Even love can't change the things he ought to change the most
And it's pride that keeps him standing when he should be on his knees
Makin' apologies but she loves him desperately
Oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet
So he'd know all the perfect lines to say
And have some great romantic way to show it
Be the hero ridin' up to save the day
And go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor
To sweep her up and carry her away
Oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her
No cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways
""I love you"" and ""I'm sorry"" are words that just don't come
Cause words like that are no match for the kind that rule his tongue
But his eyes keep tellin' her ""you know I love you anyway
No matter what I say or what I never say""
Oh but now and again she wished he'd been a poet
So he'd know all those fancy lines to say
And have some great romantic way to show it
Be the hero ridin' up to save the day
And go ridin' high like a knight in shinin' armor
And sweep her up and carry her away
Oh but he don't have no magic ways to charm her
No cause even love can't change a cowboy's ways
His ways seem cold but she knows he's much warmer
But even love can't change a cowboy's ways
He's just a fool that must defend his honor
But even love can't change a cowboy's ways"
"Waiting for the train to come
I keep a'waiting for the train to come
Dreamin' of the river and the rising sun
I keep thinkin' 'bout the world to come
My life packed up in a suitcase
Old man staring from a doorway
My hope tarries in the distance
Love comes on the wheels of my deliverance
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Waitin' for the train to come
I keep waitin' for the train to come
Keepin' my appointment with the one who lives
In the heart of everything that is
All night sleepin' in a station
My God, it's hard not to be impatient
I watch through the windows of forgiveness
I cry but my word's my only witness
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Sometimes I feel I can't go on, I can't go on
I get so tired, all passion's gone
My heart, my head, my arms, my legs, I get so tired
Without the strength to crawl away
Then something breaks inside my soul, My strength is gone
That spirit's finally taking hold
My ears can hear, my eyes can see
Those clouds of joy still cover me, cover me, cover me
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is, where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Fade:
Waiting for the train to come
I keep waiting for the train to come..."
"Fighting soldiers from the sky
Fearless men who jump and die
Men who mean just what they say
The brave men of the Green Beret
1st Chorus:
Silver wings upon their chest
These are men, America's best
One hundred men we'll test today
But only three win the Green Beret
Trained to live, off nature's land
Trained in combat, hand to hand
Men who fight by night and day
Courage deep from the Green Beret
Repeat 1st Chorus
Delta Force and CIA
Marines and SOCOM clear the way
Covert missions now in play
Special OPS like the Green Beret
Repeat 1st Chorus
While back at home a young wife waits
Her Green Beret has met his fate
He has died for those oppressed
Leaving her this last request
2nd Chorus:
Put silver wings on my son's chest
Make him one of America's best
He'll be a man they'll test one day
So have him win the Green Beret
Have him win the Green Beret
Repeat 1st Chorus"
"(Dolly Parton)
When I was a child I recall and old man; everybody loved old Zeke
He was all alone, his family was gone; one day he said to me
I'm just sittin' here thinkin' about Jesus, rockin' as my old chair creaks
Some glad day I'll fly away when Jesus comes calling for me
It might be today, it might be tomorrow, maybe one day next week
I'll soon be done with trouble and sorrow when He comes calling for me
When Jesus comes calling for me
When I die don't grieve and cry
Lordy, don't feel sorry for me
Oh what a day, what a mighty fine day
When Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me
I might be in the graveyard walking talking to my family
Or I might be plowing in the field down yonder, just old Muley and me
Wherever I am, whatever I'm a doing, some sweet day I'll see
And band of angels in a cloud of glory when Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me
When I die just close my eyes
And lay me 'neath the willow tree
Oh what a day, what a mighty fine day
When Jesus comes calling for me
When Jesus comes calling for me
I'm just sittin' here watchin' for Jesus, rockin' as my old chair creaks
Some sweet day I'll fly away when Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me"
"There's nothing left to tie us to each other anymore
The love we knew is gone and that's a fact we can't ignore
There's nothing left to loose ends on all the ties that bind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
There's no use in wasting the good years that we have left
When we might find happiness with somebody else
There's no chance for us we can see it we're not blind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
The blame belongs to both of us I guess we didn't try
Love is like a garden without care we let it die
The flower of love can't bloom if the sun don't ever shine
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
[ piano ]
The blame belongs to both of us...
Though it hurts we know we must leave it all behind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
You're wasting mine you're wasting mine"
"(Dolly Parton)
Hello, I don't know me from Adam, you don't know me from Eve
I just came here tonight 'cause I was lonely
You're no Elvis Presley, I'm no Marilyn Monroe
But I do think you're sexy, just thought I'd tell you so
Hey could I have your autograph
Your name and your number on a small photograph
I'd like to know you and what you're all about
Hey could I have your autograph
I've had my eyes on you and you're worth lookin' at
Could I ask you out or should a lady do that
You may not be famous but you look like a star
You should be in movies as cute as you are
Hey could I have your autograph
Your name and your number on a small photograph
Could I interest you in a romance perhaps
Hey could I have your autograph
Got my heart in my hands and my head in the clouds
And you're everything every girl dreams about
And being with you would be heaven no doubt
What I wouldn't do for your autograph
Oh could I have your autograph
Oh could I have your autograph
Hey could I have your autograph
I like your body could I help you work it out
Maybe moving to the music playing on the phonograph
Hey could I have your autograph
Oh could I have your autograph
You know you're just the kind to makes a woman real proud
Would you take a chance on a girl from the South
Could I have your autograph"
"How long will you love me how long will you stay by my side
Will it be for a lifetime or just for a while
From now on yes on and on
If you will love and stand by me I'll give all my love to you
That's the way that it will be from now on yes on and on
From now on yes on and on from now on yes on and on
Love for each other that will stand the test of time
From now on on and on
I'll stand by you right or wrong then we'll always be as one
Like the robin needs his song I need you from now on
Like the rose loves the vine like the poem needs to rhyme
My love is yours and yours is mine from now on on and on
From now on yes on and on...
From now on on and on"
"(Dolly Parton)
He wanted more from like
Than four kids and a wife
And a job in the dark Kentucky mines
A twenty-acre farm
With a shacky house and barn
That's all he had
And all he left behind
At gambling he was lucky
So he left Kentucky
Left behind his woman and his kids
Into the gay casino
In Nevada's town of Reno
Kentucky gambler planned to get rich quick
Kentucky gambler, who's gonna love your woman in Kentucky
Who's gonna be the one to give her what she needs
Kentucky gambler, who's gonna raise your children in Kentucky
Who's gonna keep them fed and keep shoes on their feet
At the gamblers' paradise
Lady luck was on his side
Kentucky gambler played his cards just right
He won at everything he played
Kentucky gambler had it made
And he should have quit and gone on home that night
But when you love the greenback dollar
Sorrow's always bound to follow
Reno dreams fade into neon amber
And lady luck, she'll leave you on
She'll saty awhile, and then she's gone
You'd better go on home Kentucky gambler
But a gambler never seems to stop
Til he loses all he's got
And so, Kentucky gambler, he played on
He played til he lost all he won
He was right back where he started from
Then he started wanting to go home
Kentucky gambler, there ain't nobody waiting in Kentucky
When you walked out, somebody else walked in
Kentucky gambler, looks like you ain't really very lucky
Seems to me a gambler looses much more than he wins
So you think about it
Kentucky gambler"
"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.
Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight."
"Now I've been happy lately
Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun
Oh, I've been smiling lately
Dreaming about the world as one
And I believe it could be
Someday it's going to come
'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Peace train take this country
Come take me home again
Now I've been smiling lately
Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun
[Chorus]
Peace train sounding louder
Ride on the peace train
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah
Come on peace train
Peace train holy roller
Everyone jump on the peace train
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah
Come on peace train
Get your bags together
Go bring all your good friends, too
'cause it's getting nearer
Soon it will be with you
Now come and join the living
It's not so far from you
And it's getting nearer
Soon it will all be true
[Chorus]
Now I've been crying lately
Thinking about the world as it is
Why must we go on hating
Why can't we live in bliss
'cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Where peace train take this country
Come take me home again
[Chorus]
Peace train is sounding louder
Ride on the peace train
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah
Come on peace train
Peace train holy roller
Jump up on the peace train
Ride - ride on the peace train"
"Am I to face these lonely halls alone
And when you leave, who's gonna walk me home
Cause when you walk out the door I won't see you no more
And you're the one I adore so baby
Chorus:
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't be a fool
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)
You're old enough to know you're too young to face the world so cruel
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)
You're not prepared to do anything
So if you wanna buy me that diamond ring, well
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't drop out
My parents say you're lazy but you can be smart if you try
And I know you've got a heart cause you've never ever made me cry
They say you're no good so baby do what you should
And stay here by my side oh darlin'
Repeat Chorus
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)
Don't drop out of my life
Baby, don't drop out
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)"

I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
You're wasting mine you're wasting mine"
"Baby sister, what a waste to see you in this place
I lose my mind from worrying over you
In a bar room filled with people all higher than a steeple
But I know why you do the things you do
And I curse the man that made you what you are today
I hope he dies a thousand times a thousand ways
Your eyes are filled with tears, sis let's get out of here
'Cause I love you, baby sister, let's go home
And I curse the man that made you what you are today
I hope he dies a thousand times a thousand ways
Your eyes are filled with tears, sis let's get out of here
'Cause I love you, baby sister, let's go home
'Cause I love you, baby sister, let's go home"

Carroll County's pointed out as kind of square
The biggest thing that happens is the county fair
And I guess that's why it seemed like such a big event
What we all call the Carroll County accident
The wreck was on the highway just inside the line
Walter Browning lost his life and for a time
It seemed that Mary Ellen Jones would surely die
But she lived long enough for her to testify
Now Walter Browning was a happy married man
And he wore a golden wedding ring upon his hand
But it was gone nobody knew just where it went
He'd lost it in the Carroll County accident
Mary Ellen testified he flagged her down
Said he was sick and could she drive him into town
And no one even doubted what she said was true
Cause she was well respected in the county too
Now I went down to see the wreck like all the rest
The bloody seats, the broken glass, the tangled mess
But I found something no one else had even seen
Behind the dash in Mary's crumpled up machine
A little matchbox circled by a rubberband
And inside the ring from Walter Browning's hand
And it took a while to figure out just what it meant
The truth about the Carroll County accident
By dark of night I dropped the ring into a well
And I took a sacred oath that I would never tell
The secret of the Carroll County accident
Cause the county ordered dad a marble monument
I lost him in the Carroll County accident"
"Sometimes I try to count the ways and reasons that I love you
But I can't ever seem to count that far
I love you in a million ways and for a million reasons
More than this I love you as you are
More than this I love you as you are
You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are
You are my thoughts when I'm awake, my dreams when I'm asleep
You are the reason for my smile, you are the words I speak
Every role I play in life you play the leading part
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are"

I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I love you, I do, but I can't be true
Men are my weakness I've got a roving eye
And I've fallen victim to many a smile
I just love the excitement of love when it's new
I'm just a hopeless romantic so I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true
Some play it safe while some like it hot
I guess you could say I never knew when to stop
But when I'm lovin' you, I'll give it all that I got
It might be different with you to know I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules
Now that you know it's true, I'll leave the rest up to you
I'll be good to you, but I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, its not a weakness in you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I really love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules
Now that you know it's true, I'll leave the rest up to you
I'll be good to you, but I can't be true, I can't be true"

Mine is a jealous heart
Imagines things that never are
Builds a fire from a tiny spark
But that's the way of a jealous heart
Sunny skies and a rosy bed
Thorns and storm clouds up ahead
'Cause suddenly the sky turns dark
For those of us with a jealous heart
Imagination runnin' wild
Like a frantic frightened child
Any time that we're apart
I can't control my jealous heart
And you know mine is a jealous heart
And every hurt leaves a lasting scar
Don't you hate yourself for the fool you are
When you're cursed with a jealous heart
I love you more than words can tell
One day's heaven two days hell
Suspicious words like poison darts
Spoken from my jealous heart
Mine is a jealous heart
Imagines things that never are
Builds a fire from a tiny spark
But that's the way of a jealous heart
And you know mine, you know mine is a jealous heart
And every hurt, and every hurt leaves a lasting scar
Don't you hate yourself for the fool you are
When you're cursed with a jealous heart
And you know mine, you know mine is a jealous heart
Imagines things, imagines things that never are
Builds a fire from a tiny spark
But that's the way of a jealous heart"
"New York City ain't no kind of place
For a country girl with a friendly face
If you smile people look at you funny, they take it wrong
The greenest state in the land of the free
And the home of the Grand Ole Opry
Is calling me back to my Smoky Mountain home
I wish I had my old fishin' pole
And was sitting on the banks of the fishing hole
Eating green apples and waiting for the fish to bite
Life ain't as simple as it used to be
Just since the big apple took a bite out of me
And Lord, I'm so Tennessee homesick that I could die
But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
What I wouldn't give for a little bitty taste
Of Mama's homemade chocolate cake
Tennessee homesick blues is running through my head
Mama you can fluff my feather bed
Just as soon as I can I'm gonna head
Back to the Tennessee hills and it better be soon
Daddy you can load the rifles up
We're gonna load them dogs on the pickup truck
And head up to Calhoun Country and catch us a coon
But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
Eatin' grits and gravy and country ham
Go to church on Sunday with dinner on the grounds
Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head
And I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
Good Lord, have mercy on a country girl
Tryin' to make a living in a rhinestone world
It's hard to be a diamond in a rhinestone world
With Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head
I've got those Tennessee homesick blues runnin' through my head
Tennessee homesick blues"
"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you"

Run that by me one more time
To make sure that I heard you right
I hope you don't expect me to believe that line
I might be crazy, but I ain't dumb
And I know a lie when I hear one
Would you run that by me one more time?
Well, you're late again, I see
What's your excuse this time?
Don't you try to kiss and make up
When you smell so strong from wine
Well, I'm not late, the clock is wrong
You need to wind Big Ben
Honey, that's not wine you smell
That's aftershave for men
Would you run that by me one more time?
What happened to the money
I gave you to pay the rent?
The rent is overdue
And we ain't got one red cent
I put it in the cookie jar
The day you brought it home
One day when I came back from town
I looked and I'll be dogged if that money wasn't gone!
Would you run that by me one more time?
Ha ha would you run that by me one more time
Run that by me one more time...
You keep drinkin' that aftershave it's gonna kill you if I'm lucky
You spent that money didn't you
I didn't spend it I oughta box your jaws
Oh you'd hit your mom before you hit me
Would you run that by me one more time run that by me one more time
I don't want to run that by you one more time
Shot your mouth I don't have to you ain't my pa"
"Back through the years I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
""Perhaps this coat will brang you good luck and happiness""
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colors that my momma made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my momma made for me
So with patches on my britches, holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
and my coat of many colors my momma made for me
And oh I couldn't understand that for I thought I was rich
And then I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed
And why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes
They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
One is only poor only if you choose to be
It is true we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors momma made for me
Made just for me"
"We don't take away one happy moment
We won't take away any of the new
We'll do anything to make each other happy
Love is give and take but we don't take away
I never thought that love could make you feel so happy
I thought I'd found love once but I wasn't even close not even close
Well you make me want to call you sweet names at the waking of each day
For each day I love you more and we won't ever take away
We don't take away one happy moment...
Love is give and take but we don't take away take away"

From a shack by a mountain stream
To a room in New Orleans
So far from my Blue Ridge Mountain home
The men I meet ain't warm and friendly
Like the one in old Virginie
Oh they ain't real like my Blue Ridge Mountain boy
I was just a little past eighteen
When I came to New Orleans
I'd never been beyond my home state line
There was a boy who loved me dearly
But I broke his heart severely
When I left my Blue Ridge Mountain boy
Life was dull in my hometown
Lights were out when the sun went down
And I thought that city life was more my style
But nights get lonely away from home
And it's easy to go wrong
The men ain't kind like my Blue Ridge Mountain boy
New Orleans held things in store
Things I'd never bargained for
And every night a different man knocks on my door
But late at night when all is still
I can hear a whippoorwill
As I cry for my Blue Ridge Mountain boy
Oh but I can never go back home
Since the boy I love is gone
He grew tired of waiting for me to return
They say he married last October
But I never will get over
Oh the sweet love of my Blue Ridge Mountain boy
Blue Ridge Mountain boy"
"The truth is too painful
This moment too real
Saying good-bye
But loving you still
Too late to start over
We've tried that before
And I just don't have it in me
To try anymore
Chorus:
But I know I'll miss you
And I know I'll cry
I know you loved me
And I know you've tried
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever do in my life
But I know no good way
Of saying good-bye
2nd chorus:
I know I'll miss you
And I know I'll cry
I know you loved me
And I know I'll ask why
I know I'll have moments
When I'll want to die
But I know no good way
Of saying good-bye
Tag:
And the longest night
I'll ever spend will be tonight
'cause I know no good way of saying"
"You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind
Oh yes you did you started it like you start all our fights
No I didn't do no such thing and let that a dirty lie
Nothin's ever your fault and nothin's ever mine
You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind
Well you've burned the supper up again that's nothing new
I just figured you'd pack that all on me
Well you're the one that caused it oh it's always me
When you're always lookin' faults ain't hard to find
We delight in pickin' fights cause our love's the fightin' kind
Two lovers both too stubborn
To take the blame for anything do we blame it on the other
Some love is understanding and there's careless love in line
It takes all sorts and mine and yours is known as the fightin' kind
Okay Miss Priss what is it now now I know you done this
What how am I supposed to shave that ain't never been my problem
Now I don't care about you using my razor
But did you have to use my brand new blade
New blade boy it's good that is really good
That's real good to think I went to all that trouble tryin' to fix that nice for you
That's fixed up nice I'll probably keep it for washin' the soap off the wall
Oh there ain't no soap or I ain't got no television in the bathroom
And that new blade that you vedrudged me had already been used
Two lovers both too stubborn
To take the blame for anything so we blame it on the other
What's mine is yours what's yours is yours and so on down the line
You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind
You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind"
"Here I sit all alone, thinkin' 'bout what I should have known
You made me think that I could need you
You weaved your magic spell and I believed you
Lookin back on you and me
Promises that will never be
I truly thought that we were lovers
But now I find that I'm just like all the others
Heartbreaker, wish I'd seen that love was blind
Sweet little love maker
Takin my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker couldn't you be
Just a little more kind to me
Played with fire, felt its burn
I would have thought that I would have learned
I melted every time you kissed me
Each time you'd leave I thought that you would miss me
Heartbreaker, wish that I'd seen that love was blind
Sweet little love maker
Takin' my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker couldn't you be
A little more kind to me
Heartbreaker, wish that I had seen that love was blind
Sweet little love maker
Takin' my heart and leave me behind
Heartbreaker couldn't you be
Just a little more kind to me"
"Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your roof's too close at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You are the reason I'm traveling home
Don't think twice, it's alright
There ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
That night, I never know'd
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me want to change my mind and stay
We never did do much talking anyway
Don't think twice, it's alright, no
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright
But there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
Like you never did before
And there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
'Cause I can't hear you anymore
Well, I'm thinking and wonderin' all the way down the road
I once loved a man but that love grew old
I gave him my heart, but he wanted my soul
Don't think twice, it's alright
Walking down that lone lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound well I can't tell
But goodbye is too good a way, babe
So I'm gonna say thee farewell
But I ain't saying you treated me unkind
You could have loved me better, but no, I don't mind
But you just kinda sorta wasted my precious time
Don't think twice, it's alright, no
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright"
"Oh, say can you see,
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,
Through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched,
Were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare,
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?"
"I'm a brave little soldier
I must be bold and strong
A brave little soldier
And I must carry on
I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
I'm a brave little soldier
I must fight, I must win
I'm a brave little soldier
Through hell and back again
I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
Per rum, pum, pum
Per rum, pum, pum
Per rum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Ye though I am marching through the valley filled with fear
My steps are sure and sturdy and my aim is straight and clear
The enemy is stalking me just waiting for the kill
Like david slewed galiath
I will claim this battle field
I'm a brave little soldier
I must do what I can
I'm a brave little soldier
And I must take a stand
I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
Marching, marching onward
Searching out the light of truth
I did not start the war
But it's a battle I can't lose
Faith will be my armor
And love my sword and shield
I must defeat the enemy
I will, I will, I will
A brave little soldier
I must be bold and strong
A brave little soldier
And I must carry on
A brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
I'm a brave little soldier
A brave little soldier
Brave, little soldier"

In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
My love, my love, what have I done
To make you treat me so
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
You've caused me to leave my home
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia Line
The engine passed at six o'clock
The caboose went by at nine
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo"

Well I met a boy from Grassy Branch
Fine as he can be
I met him at the big barn dance
And he took a shine to me
Sky-blue eyes, a big wide smile
And tall as a sycamore tree
He's real smart with a real big heart
And he's gonna marry me
He's gonna marry me
And we're gonna go to town
We're gonna buy some real good car
And we're gonna drive around
We'll hold hands an' touch 'n' hug
He talks so sweet to me
Cause he knows a lot about love and stuff
And he's gonna marry me
His momma don't like me one little bit
But you know I don't care
Let her pitch her hissy-fit
Cause I ain't a'marryin' her
He's always been a momma's boy
It's just plain jealousy
She's as mad as an old wet hen
Cause he's gonna marry me
Oh, an' he's gonna marry me
An' he's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little babe of three
Cause he done kiss me on the mouth
An' he's gonna marry me
Yeah, he's gonna marry me
He's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little babe of three
Cause he's done kiss me on the mouth
So he's gotta marry me
Yeah he's done kiss me on the mouth
And he's gonna marry me

Busy signal
That's what I get when I call you
Busy busy
Talking to someone new
I wish I knew
I shouldn't worry 'cause it's probably his mother
Or then again it could even be his little brother
On the line
Making me lose my mind
Hang up hang up hang up hang up
Come on hang up hang up hang up
Gotta talk to my baby
Gotta tell him I'm sorry
Busy signal
How can I tell him I'm sorry
When I said I didn't care
I didn't mean a word I said
Talking outta my head
I've got to reach him now and tell him that I love him
And from now on I'll stay right by his side and love him
All the time
So please somebody quit tying up the line
Hang up hang up hang up hang up
Come on hang up hang up hang up
Gotta talk to my baby
Gotta tell him I'm sorry
I didn't mean to hurt you baby
I really really love you baby"

Eve you wicked woman, you done put your curse on me
Why didn't you just leave that apple hangin' in the tree
You make us hate our husbands, our lovers and our boss
Why I can't even count the good friends I've already lost
Cause of PMS blues, PMS blues
I don't even like myself, but it's something I can't help
I got those God almighty, slap somebody PMS blues
Most times I'm easy going, some say I'm good as gold
But when I'm PMS I tell ya, I turn mean and cold
Those not afflicted with it are affected just the same
You poor old men didn't have to grin and say ""I feel your pain""
PMS blues, PMS blues
You know you must forgive us for we care not what we do
I got those can't stop crying, dishes flying PMS blues
But you know we can't help it
We don't even know the cause
But as soon as this part's over, then comes the menopause
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord
We're going to always be a heap of fun
Like the devil taking over my body, suffering, suffering, suffering
Everybody's suffering, huh?
But a woman had to write this song, a man would be scared to
Lest he be called a chauvenist or just fall victim to
Those PMS blues
You know we'd kill for less than that
PMS blues
You don't want to cross my path
Cause a pitbull ain't no match
For these teeth a clenchin', fluid retention
Head a swellin', can't stop yellin'
Got no patience, I'm so hateful
PMS blues, premenstrual syndrome
Got those moods a swingin', tears a slingin'
Nothin' fits me when it hits me
Rantin', ravin', misbehavin'
PMS blues"
"How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
And how many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
So always make me wonder
And always make me guess
Even if I ask you
Darlin', don't confess
No you just let that remain your secret
'Cause darlin' I do love you so
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know"
"Well this big city life is gettin' me down
There's just too many people around
There's dirt in the air and crime in the street
High-rise buildings and cold concrete
This rat race sure enough takes a toll
I want to run off to my fishin' hole
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Where the stars at night
Outshine those city lights
Take me back to the country
Where the eagles fly
And the treetops touch the sky
Take me back to the country
This traffic jam is makin' me mad
I miss the simple life I had
Peace and quite runnin' free
I want to go home to my family
I'm sick of the clock, sick of the phone
Out in the country my time's my own
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Take me back take me back
Take me back to the country
Where the stars at night
Outshine those city lights
Take me back to the country
Where the eagles fly
And the treetops touch the sky
Take me back to the country"
"There's a picture that I carry
One we made some time ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me
I say just ""Someone I use to know""
Just someone, I used to spend some time with
Just a flame, that's lost its glow
But I don't them of the nights I cried without you
I say just ""Someone I use to know""
Just someone, I use to run around with
Just a friend from long ago
I don't tell them, how lost I am without you
I say just ""Someone I use to know""
I say just ""Someone I use to know"""

There is no love and there is no hate there is no feeling at all
I look at you and you look at me but we might as well stare at the wall
Cause you don't see me and I don't see you just the shadow of love that is gone
There is no love and there is no hate no reason to hurry home
There's no tiny hands to reach out to us no plans bein' made anymore
We have no tomorrow our future is gone there is only sadness in store
We don't care enough to even ask questions
And when we're together we still feel alone
There is no love and there is no hate no reason to hurry home
There is nothing to look forward to no reason to hurry home"
"You were not content with me when I was like I used to be
I was too old-fashioned, too simple and too plain
And so you took this country girl, taught me all about the world
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
I used to never drink or smoke, I'd even blush at dirty jokes
I never wanted to take part in all those worldly games
But you dressed me up in sexy clothes, took me where the swingers go
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
But you don't want me swingin' now, but you're the one that taught me how
It was you that wanted me to change
I'm only what you made of me, your mistake was changin' me
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
You want me like I was before but I'm not like that anymore
This plain, old, simple, country girl won't ever be the same
So don't expect me to go back 'cause it's a bit too late for that
And you're the one that taught me how to swing"
"Darling it's not really over it just seems to be
Darling I don't really think that we want to be free
A raging storm of anger made us want to end it all
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
These tiny drops of pain that's falling down our face
Tomorrow will be gone almost without a trace
It's hurtin' now but soon we'll find it doesn't hurt at all
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
In each love some pain must fall that doesn't mean that it's the end
When the anger is all gone everything will be all right again
And the hurt that seems so big now tomorrow will seem small
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
[ guitar ]
In each love some pain must fall...
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall"
"I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at'all
So tell me why should it be true?
That I get a kick out of you
Some people go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
Still I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you
Standin' there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously don't adore me, aww
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothin' to do
Still I get a kick out of you
Yes I get a kick out of you"
"Fresh scrubbed hot off the bus
Dressed up and feeling good
Eyes full of stars a heart full of dreams
Daisy Mae in Hollywood
Struttin' down the boulevard
The walkway of the stars
With a vision of her name in lights
Reflecting off the cars
And dreaming of a white limozeen
She wants to have a white limozeen
Well, the days to come were long and dark
And the nights were hard and cold
She met the devil in the City of Angels
But she never lost her soul
She kept her dreams close to her heart
Like a family photograph
She cried sometimes and died sometimes
But still she knows how to laugh
Dreaming of a white limozeen
Dreaming of a white limozeen
Now she's a living her dreams like a movie queen
Diamond rings and all things good
From the breadlines to the headlines
She's the toast of Hollywood
White limozeen
White limozeen
Now she's really ridin' high
She's a woman of the world
But deep inside she never changed
She's the same old down home girl
And when the airplane brings the kinfolk
To visit for awhile
There's a friendly guy in a red bow tie
To take 'em around in style
He drives 'em in a white limozeen
She finally got a white limozeen
Now she's a living her dreams like a movie queen
Diamond rings and all things good
From the breadlines to the headlines
She's the toast of Hollywood
She was fresh scrubbed hot off the bus
Dressed up and feelin' good
Eyes full of stars a heart full of dreams
Daisy Mae in Hollywood
She goes struttin' down the boulevard
The walkway of the stars
With a vision of her name in lights
Reflectin' off the cars
And dreamin' of a white limozeen
She finally got a white limozeen
Oh, ridin' in a white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen"
"Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you
Close the door to temptation
don't let me walk through
Turn away from me, darling
I'm begging you to
Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you
I belong to another
Whose arms have grown cold
But i promised forever
To have and to hold
I can never be free, dear
But when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing
The will to be true
Please help me, I'm falling
And that would be sin
Close the door to temptation
don't let me walk in
For i mustn't want you
But, darling, i do
Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you"
"I really got the feeling that I'll love you for a long long time
I felt it from the moment we met you didn't ask me my sign
I love my daddy but it really don't matter what my daddy might say
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day
You're a gentle man
And a gentle man is getting mighty hard to find these days
And you're a tender man
And you're man enough to show your love and tender ways
I really got the feeling that I'll love you for a long long time
I felt it from the moment we met you didn't ask me my sign
I love my daddy but it really don't matter what my daddy might say
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day
I love those silly things you do
You make me feel once more like an innocent child of two
I really got the feeling that I'll love you for a long long time
I felt it from the moment we met you didn't ask me my sign
I love my daddy but it really don't matter what my daddy might say
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day
I really got the feeling got the feeling
I really got the feeling got the feeling
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day"
"Sometimes I think of you and tears fill my eyes
To think of the meaning youve given my life
Youve touched me in places no one ever reached
Youve given me reason and cause to believe
You are my rainbow, youve colored my life
And you are my sunshine, Im warm in your light
You are my fountain that never runs dry
Youre my inspiration, my reason to try
Ill love you til green grass turns lavender blue
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew
Til horses and chariots chase down the wind
Thats when Ill leave you, Ill love you til then
Ill love you til green grass turns lavender blue
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew
Til horses and chariots chase down the wind
Thats when Ill leave you, Ill love you til then
Ill love you til green grass turns lavender blue
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew
Til horses and chariots chase down the wind
Thats when Ill leave you, Ill love you til then
Thats when Ill leave you, yes
Ill leave you then
Ill need you til then
Ill love you til then"
"Ping pong
I use to like
Ping pong
Now I'm in a ding dong, ping pong game of love with you
Ping pong
It scares me now
Ping pong
My heart is the ball in a ding dong, ping pong game with you
I serve it to you
And you knock it back
You hit it so hard, hard, hard
Its startin' to crack
Ping pong
You're smashed again
Ping pong
And I'm losing this ding dong, ping pong game of love with you
I serve it to you
And you knock it back
You hit it so hard, hard, hard
Its starting to crack
Ping pong
You're smashed again
Ping pong
I'm losing this ding dong, ping pong game of love with you
Ping pong
I use to like
Ping pong
Now I'm in a ding dong, ping pong game of love with you
Ping pong
It scares me now..."

Blue me, blue me
Blue is the color
That fits best on me
I'm blue
Just as blue as can be
Blue me, Blue me
I cry
And I die
I lie awake at night
And I question why
Must it be
I can never be free
Blue me, Blue me
My heart is heavy
But it's empty inside
No one to love me
Or to lay down beside
I'm blue
The queen of sorrow
Wears royal blue
My luck ain't changin'
Is it ever goin' to
I'm blue, Oh I'm blue
Why must I wear this robe of blue misery
Blue me, Blue me
Ooh
This sad old feeling
Is breakin' me down
No satisfaction with these blues hangin' 'round
Lord, I'm blue
Oh, I'm so blue Why can't I shake it tell me where will this end
When will I get out of this blue rut I'm in
Oh, I'm blue
Looks like the blues just took a liking to me
Blue me, Blue me Blue me, Blue me
Blue is the color that fits best on me
Ooooh, I'm blue
I'm just as blue as can be
Blue me
Blue me"
"You're the one that puts the sparkle in my eyes
You're the one that puts the laughter in my smile
You're the one that puts the meaning in my life
And I'm bubbling over, bubbling over, bubbling over
Because you are mine
Bubbling over with the joy that only love can bring
Bubbling over with the song you taught my heart to sing
And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone can see
That I'm bubbling over, bubbling over, bubbling over
Because you love me
I have never known a love that felt like this
You're the one I want to share my lovin' with
Your gentle way of lovin' me and your thoughtfulness
Keeps me bubbling over, bubbling over, bubbling over
With happiness
Bubbling over with the joy that only love can bring
Bubbling over with the song you taught my heart to sing
And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone could see
That I'm bubbling over, bubbling over, bubbling over
Because you love me"
"Remember all the castles that we once built in the sand
Remember how we used to go and visit fairy land
Remember how we'd search for that pot of gold at the rainbow's end
But you loved me then
And the flowers the we picked from the fields where we did run
And the sunbeams that we'd catch from the summer's golden sun
And the butterflies we'd chase as we'd go running through the wind
But you loved me then
Now I walk through the ruins of our castles in the sand
When you left I lost my way forever and the fairy land
Now the rainbows have all gone and the flowers have all died
And the sunbeams that we caught have all gone free again
And the butterfiles we chased have all gone with the wind
And you no longer care but you love me then
(And you no longer care) but you love me then
(And you no longer care) but you love me then"
"(Dolly Parton)
Walter, Walter Henry
I say Walter Henry Hagan
You done gone and broke my heart
Walter, Walter Henry
You know that I believed you
When you swore we'd never part
Well you said you had to have me
And well you dang well did
You took me from my country home
When I was just a kid
And you took me off to Boston
Put a baby on my knee
Left me to dangle-dingle
So far from Tennessee
Now Patrick might have been one
But you ain't been no saint
But a good ole' Irish boy
They say we'll always have this drink
And you just won't stop chasin'
All those other woman around
A' ramblin' and a'gamblin'
Throwin' Irish whiskey down
Walter, Walter Henry
Walter Henry Hagan
You don't listen when I call
Walter, Walter Henry
Of all the men I've ever loved
I loved you best of all
Oh play one for ol' Walter Henry boys
Walter, Walter Henry
Walter Henry Hagan
You done left your mark on me
Walter, Walter Henry
If you ever sober up
I'm waitin' back in Tennessee
If you ever sober up
I'm waitin' back in Tennessee
Walter, Walter Henry
Yoddle-le-ee-hee
Yoddle-le-ee-hee

You done left your mark on me"
"Oh, I wish I was a kissin' tree
A growin' in the ground
And every time my sweet pass by
I'd throw some kisses down
And if he wants more kisses
Here's all he has to do
Just come up here that kissin' tree
And I'll give him some kissin' to
I love a tall man, he ain't a small man
My man is all man and the only man for me
Now I wish, I was a kissin' tree out
On the lone prairie
And every time my sweet pass by
He'd steal a kiss from me
And if he wants more kisses
Here's all he has to know
Just plant me down in a Texas town
And watch them kisses grow
I love a tall man, he ain't a small man
My man is all man and the only man for me
And the only one for me ooh"
"Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
Saying something about a queen
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run in the 20th century
Look at Mother Nature on the run in the 20th century
I was lying in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eye
I was hoping for replacement
When the sun burst through the sky
There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like I could cry
I was thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There was children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home"
"There'll be love love love oh precious love
Just as long as there's two people there'll be love
In spite of hate that fills the land love will always have command
As long as there's two people there'll be love
God created man and woman at the start
And he placed inside of them a lovin' heart
But it wasn't God that made the hate and lust
But as long as there's two people there'll be love
There'll be love love love...
[ guitar ]
For every person somewhere there's a mate
It's the force for survival that brings hate
For even though the going might be rough
As long as there's two people there'll be love
You can lock a man behind a prison wall
And you may think that he has no love at all
But there's someone somewhere that he's thinking of
For as long as there's two people there'll be love"
"(Dolly Parton)
Hello you said the day we met
Handing me a yellow rose
You asked me out
And to your surprise
And to mine I said I'd go
I thought it so romantic
And I found you sweet and bold
Though we'd only met
I still said yes
To a single yellow rose
And for years to come
You were the one
To sleep with me at night
To laugh and talk
And share my thoughts
And hold me when I'd cry
And on every occasion
And for no good reason to
A big bouquet or a single yellow rose
Was sent from you
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so
I never see a yellow rose
That I didn't think of you
It's still my favorite flower
Though the yellow's turned to blue
The day you left my teardrops fell
Upon your farewell not
You said goodbye like you said hello
With a single yellow rose
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
Oh I still love you so
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Sweet yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so"
"(Dolly Parton)
Sweeter than honey, as soft as a sigh
Gentle as snowflakes but warm as July
This is the way I remember your kiss
If I live forever, I'll never forget
Misty as morning, as blue as the sky
Reflections of Heaven in your loving eyes
Eyes that said more than your words ever did
And if I live forever, I'll never forget
If I live forever, I'll never forget
It's you that I'm wanting to spend my life with
Do I still love you? The answer is yes.
And if I live forever, I'll never forget
Two loving arms that I felt welcomin'
Arms that I've run to again and again
How do you erase sweet memories you miss
If I live forever, I'll never forget
Sad circumstances that stood between us
Wouldn't let us share our precious, sweet love
Do you remember, do you feel like this?
If I live forever, I'll never forget
If I live forever, I'll never forget
It's you that I wanted to share my life with
Do I still love you? The answer is yes.
And if I live forever, I'll never forget
Do you remember, do you feel like this?
If I live forever, I'll never forget"
"Who do you think you are
What do you think this is
A game you can play
Tryin' to steal him away
Well, I don't need a heartache like this
Well, don't think I don't go through hell
But heaven is what we both want
He's easy to love, but he's hard to give up
And if you think I will, well, you're wrong
The best woman wins
I will fight 'til the end
I'll lay down and die if I must
I'll beg and I'll plead
I will suffer and bleed
But he must make a choice between us
This soap opera play that we're in
Is just like you watch on t.v.
But I never thought that I'd ever get caught in it;
Starring you, him and me
In love as in war all is fair
So a fight to the finish begins
When you fight from desire
You fight fire with fire
So may the best woman win
The best woman wins
I will fight 'til the end
I'll lay down and die if I must
I'll beg and I'll plead
I will suffer and bleed
But he must make a choice between us
So may the best woman win"
"(Dolly Parton)
Like the Phoenix
From the ash and dirt
I rose up from the pain and hurt
When I was at my very worst
I found you
Thought I could never love again
When a spark of light came beaming in
A thread of hope
For me to spin around you
Chorus:
Unlikely Angel
Standing there in front of me
As if you were my destiny
Like we were always meant to be together
Unlikely Angel
It feels so right inside your love
Like God has sent you from above
To honor, cherish, and to love forever
The smile upon your angel face
The heaven in your eyes replace
The hell that I've been going through
Before you
How long have you been there for me
I once was blind but now I see
A future full of hope
How I adore you
Repeat Chorus
Unlikely Angel
Oh, you never know where one might be
In sacred halls or crowded streets
But God has sent one straight down to me from heaven
Unlikely Angel
Unlikely Angel
Unlikely Angel
Unlikely Angel
Hmmmm
Whisper:
Unlikely Angel"
"In grave in my mind there are pictures mem'ries of a love I knew one time
So I find in my thoughts I stand looking
At the mem'ries hanging on the walls of my mind
I see a mem'ry of raindrops falling in the park on the day we met
Walking with each other through the rain laughing talking as we both got soak and wet
The mem'ry made that day I could never put away
That's the day he told me he'd be mine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
And I have a mem'ry of springtime cherry blossoms and bird singing on the vine
And the secret place we'd hide and laid together side by side
And the love that shined so brightly in his eyes
Springtime I recall was the sweetest time of all
That's the season our hearts became entwine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
Through the spring and summer he loved me and his love died with autumn leaves
His love was the wild and restless kind
When he left he left with me so many memories
He left them hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
Mhm mhm hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
He left them hanging on my mind"
"Du-u-u Du-u-u Du-u-u-u-u-u wa Du-u wa
My love for you is deeper than the depths of any ocean,
And as faithful as the stars that grace the night,
As constant as the sun making its journey through heavens,
and we'll always be together you and I.
--
[Chorus]
Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine.
Paint a pretty rainbow, brushed with love across the sky,
Together you and I belong, like a songbird and a song
and we'll always be together you and I
--
Life with you is sweeter than the fragrance of the flowers
And as happy as the laughter of a child
As peaceful as a river and as lasting as forever
you know we'll always be together you and I
[Chorus]
I always be beside or close behind you.
Wherever you go, you'll always know I'll always find you
[Chorus]
We'll always be together, you and I
Forever together, forever you and I
(forever you and I du-du)
Forever together, together you and I will always be
(together, together)
Together, you and I........"
"You kindle the fire of love inside me
Each time our lips meet
I'm not strong when we're alone
Your kisses make me weak
You must know how I feel
But do you feel the same
Everytime you kiss me
You add fuel to the flame
My eyes light up when I see you
I burn with desire
Each time you're near
You say you'll care
But still I'm not sure
But please don't ask me to love you
If you're not gonna change my name
Everytime you touch me
You add fuel to the flame
This fire you started inside me
Has reached my very soul
You're adding fuel to a flame
That's already burning out of control
When you give me your name
I give you everything
Everytime you kiss me
Adds fuel to the flame
Yes everytime you touch me
You add fuel to the flame"
"Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down they're not aware that I'm around
Here I am crying my heart out, feeling sorry
But they're having a party just two doors down
I think I'll dry these useless tears and get myself together
I think I'll wander down the hall and have a look around
'Cause I can't stay inside this lonely room and cry forever
I think I'd really rather join 'em two doors down
Two doors down we're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down they're all aware that I'm around
Here I am no longer crying and feeling sorry
We're having a party just two doors down
I can't believe I'm standing here dry-eyed, all smiles & talkin'
Making conversation with the new love I've found
I ask him if he'd like to be alone and we start walkin'
Down the hall to my place waiting two doors down,yeah
Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down we're not aware that they're around
'Cause here I am feeling everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down
Oh oh oh oh two doors down
Oh oh oh oh two doors down
Oh oh oh oh two doors down
Oh oh oh oh two doors down
Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down we're not aware that they're around
'Cause here I am feeling everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down
Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down we're not aware that they're around
Here I end feeling everything but sorry"
"(Dolly Parton)
I know this dress I'm wearing doesn't hide the secret I've tried concealing
When he left he promised me he'd be back by the time it was revealing
The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow o'er the fields of clover
And time is running out for me, I wish that he would hurry down from Dover
He's been gone so long, when he left the snow was deep upon the ground
And I have seen a spring and summer pass and now the leaves are turning brown
At any time a tiny face will show itself 'cause waiting's almost over
But I won't have a name to give it if he doesn't hurry down from Dover, from Dover, from Dover
My folks weren't understanding, when they found out they sent me from the home place
My daddy said if folks found out he'd be ashamed to ever show his face
My mamma said I was a fool, she did not believe it when I told her
Momma, everything's gonna be all right 'cause soon he would be coming down from Dover
I found a place to stay out on a farm takin' care of that old lady
She never asked me nuthin' so I never talked to her about my baby
I sent a messgae to my mom with a name and address of Ms. ol' Grover
And to make sure he got that information when he came down from Dover
I loved him more than anything and I could not refuse him when he needed me
He was the only one I'd loved and I just can't believe that he was usin' me
He wouldn't leave me here like this, I know it can't be so, it can't be over
He wouldn't make me go through this alone, he'll be coming down from Dover
My body aches the time is here it's lonely in this place where I'm lying
Our baby has been born, but something's wrong, it's too still, I hear no crying
I guess in some strange way she knew she'd never have a father's arms to hold her
So dying was her way of tellin' me he wasn't coming down from Dover, from Dover, from Dover
Down from Dover"
"All your love lifting me higher
Than I ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
Then I'll be at your side forevermore
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
Now once I was downhearted
This little loneliness my foes and friend
But when you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
I'm so glad I finally found you
Yes that one in a million girl
And now with my loving arms around you
I can stand up and face the world
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher"
"Cindy was a ragged angel just a poor little girl on the street
Cindy's eyes showed signs of hunger never had enough to eat
Cindy was a ragged angel golden hair and eyes of blue
Cindy loved her paper dolly that's the only love she knew
Cindy never knew her daddy and her mommie was seldom home
Except for Cindy's paper dolly Cindy was all alone
Cindy slept with her paper dolly on a blanket on the floor
She would shiver as the wind blew through the crack beneath the door
One night she laid with her paper dolly cold and hungry on the floor
That night God came for the ragged angel
And now Cindy won't ever be cold and hungry no not anymore
Ragged angel"
"(Dolly Parton)
Raindrops tumble to the ground
Making puddles all around
Drops of rain that look like tears
Fall on my window pane
Raindrops seem to harmonize
With teardrops falling from my eyes
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
Steady as the rain they fall
Tears that just won't dry at all
Tears that cannot wash away the pain
Sometimes without knowing it
I touch my face and find it wet
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
I can't face the fact that
I am not important in your life
Once you lived for rollin' me
And then your feelings changed
There's just no gettin' over you
I try so hard, but it's no use
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
Raindrops just keep falling down
Beatin' out their rhythmic sounds
Dancin' as they play their sweet refrain
Memories of you cloud my mind
Cloud my eyes and I start cryin'
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
As steady as the rain
Steady as the rain they fall
Tears that just won't dry at all
Tears that just won't wash away the pain
Memories of you cloud my mind
Cloud my eyes and I start cryin'
And my tears keep falling down
As steady as the rain
As steady as the rain"
"The only way out is to walk over me
So you found someone else and you're going to leave
Did she tell you I don't love you did you really believe
On the floor by the door I'll be down on my knees
Cause the only way out is to walk over me
You don't hear and you don't feel but I know you can see
Just to prove that I love you I'll crawl at your feet
Just look down at the ground where your footprints will be
Cause the only way out is to walk over me
You have put me just as low as anyone ought to go
But I lay down beside what's left of my pride
If you go then you'll know cause you can't help but see
That the only way out is to walk over me
You have put me just as low...
Yes the only way out is to walk over me"
"You ought to go north somebody told us
'Cause the air is filled with gold dust
And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands
Now I don't recall who said it
But we'd spent our lives on credit
And so we headed out to find our promised land
Just poor Smokey Mountains farm folk
With nothing more than high hopes
So we hitched our station wagon to a star
But our dreams all fell in on us
'Cause there was no land of promise
Lord it's a struggle just keepin' sight of who you are
Oh, and these northern nights are dreary
My old southern heart is weary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I know that they all love me
And I know they're thinking of me
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong
You know I've been thinkin' just a whole lot lately
About what's been and what awaits me
It takes all I've got to give what life demands
Lord, you go insane if you give in to it
Life's a mill and I've been through it
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands
Oh, and these northern nights they're dreary
These old southern eyes are teary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus
I know He'll love and guide and lead us
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong
If I'll keep looking to the Father
He'll keep my heads above the water
While the Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong
My home sweet home"
"(Dolly Parton)
Spotlight's on, it's shining bright
And I like standin' in it
It's only superficial light
But I don't want to end it
It's warmth and glow has taken hold
And I'm caught uup in it's shine
A Cinderella fairy tale
I want to claim as mine
Fancy clothes, a magic coach
And happy ever after
Like something from a story book
The Cinderella chapter
But when the clock strikes midnight
And I lie awake in bed
Things my Daddy told me
Keep running through my head
You gotta walk the straight and narrow
And to thine own self be true
Gotta aim straight as an arrow
All eyes are up on you
But sometimes it feels so good
That I can almost justify
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Is it wrong for me to want
The sweeter grass that's greener?
To chase the all-American dream
I've always been a dreamer
At the top and still I've got
A heavy heart inside
I keep remembering
Things my Daddy told me as a child
You gotta walk the striaght and narrow
Gotta hold fast to the right
Gotta aim straight as an arrow
Walk onward toward the light
Oh, but when I'm out there in it
I think I might get by
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
But I don't feel right livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
All the fame and fortune
Glory and prestige
Can't make me happy if it goes
Against what I believe
And I've sacrificed my honor
My values and my pride
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie -- livin' a lie
Livin' a lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, I don't feel right"
"Waiting for the train to come
I keep a'waiting for the train to come
Dreamin' of the river and the rising sun
I keep thinkin' 'bout the world to come
My life packed up in a suitcase
Old man staring from a doorway
My hope tarries in the distance
Love comes on the wheels of my deliverance
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Waitin' for the train to come
I keep waitin' for the train to come
Keepin' my appointment with the one who lives
In the heart of everything that is
All night sleepin' in a station
My God, it's hard not to be impatient
I watch through the windows of forgiveness
I cry but my word's my only witness
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Sometimes I feel I can't go on, I can't go on
I get so tired, all passion's gone
My heart, my head, my arms, my legs, I get so tired
Without the strength to crawl away
Then something breaks inside my soul, My strength is gone
That spirit's finally taking hold
My ears can hear, my eyes can see
Those clouds of joy still cover me, cover me, cover me
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Oh-oh-oooh-oh where is, where is the river unbroken
Oh-oh-oooh-oh when will the whistle blow
Fade:
Waiting for the train to come
I keep waiting for the train to come..."

Eve you wicked woman, you done put your curse on me
Why didn't you just leave that apple hangin' in the tree
You make us hate our husbands, our lovers and our boss
Why I can't even count the good friends I've already lost
Cause of PMS blues, PMS blues
I don't even like myself, but it's something I can't help
I got those God almighty, slap somebody PMS blues
Most times I'm easy going, some say I'm good as gold
But when I'm PMS I tell ya, I turn mean and cold
Those not afflicted with it are affected just the same
You poor old men didn't have to grin and say ""I feel your pain""
PMS blues, PMS blues
You know you must forgive us for we care not what we do
I got those can't stop crying, dishes flying PMS blues
But you know we can't help it
We don't even know the cause
But as soon as this part's over, then comes the menopause
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord
We're going to always be a heap of fun
Like the devil taking over my body, suffering, suffering, suffering
Everybody's suffering, huh?
But a woman had to write this song, a man would be scared to
Lest he be called a chauvenist or just fall victim to
Those PMS blues
You know we'd kill for less than that
PMS blues
You don't want to cross my path
Cause a pitbull ain't no match
For these teeth a clenchin', fluid retention
Head a swellin', can't stop yellin'
Got no patience, I'm so hateful
PMS blues, premenstrual syndrome
Got those moods a swingin', tears a slingin'
Nothin' fits me when it hits me
Rantin', ravin', misbehavin'
PMS blues"
"(Dolly Parton)
Glory to His name, oh, holy, holy
There's a city where the streets are paved in gold
A land where the milk and the honey flow
And a mansion which for me
'Cause my bible tells the story
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
Green meadows where the little children play
No sorrow there, just one long happy day
And none will litter there except the pure and the holy
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
And when I've reached my journey's end
And if I'm worthy to go in
Golden streets of glory, I walk on
And the golden streets of my new home
Will lead me up to the master's throne
With the angel band I'll sing
Glory to His name, oh, holy, holy
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
Hallelujah, I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
And when I've reached my journey's end
And if I'm worthy to go in
Golden streets of glory, I'll walk on
And the golden streets of my new home
Will lead me up to the master's throne
With the angel band I'll sing
Glory to His name, oh, holy, holy
I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory
Hallelujah, I just hope my feet are clean enough
To walk upon the golden streets of glory"

Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll fly away to you, if only pretending
We'll be like bluebirds do, the beautiful lie
The beautiful lie, the beautiful lie
Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll find my way to you, if I'm only pretending
And we'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie
We'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie"
"Soft as the voice of an angel, breathing a lesson unheard
Hope with a gentle persuasion whispers her comforting word
Wait till the darkness is over, wait till the tempest is gone
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow, after the shower is gone
Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice
Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice"
"(Dolly Parton)
I open up my door to greet the early morning sun
Closing it behind me and away I do run
To the meadow where the meadow lark is singing in the tree
In the meadow I go walking in the early morning breeze
I cup my hands to catch a multi-colored butterfly
Perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild
Freeing it I watch it as it flies away from me
To visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze
Rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums
Drops of morning dew still linger on the iris leaves
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze
Misty-eyed I look about the meadow where I stray
For its there I find the courage to greet the coming day
For there among the flowers I kneel gently to my knees
To have a word with God in the early mornig breeze"
"(Dolly Parton)
Momma never seemed to miss the finer things in life
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
The only things that seemed to be important in her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Momma never wanted anymore than what she had
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
He often left her all alone
She didn't mind the stayin' home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers
And the gifts he never gave her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
And she didn't need those things to make her happy
She didn't even seem to notice
That he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
One morning we awoke
Just to find the note
That momma carefully wrote
And left to daddy
And as he began to read it
Our ears could not believe it
The words that she had written there to daddy
She said our kids are old enough
And they don't need me very much
So I've gone in search for love I need so badly
I have needed you so long
But I just can't keep holdin' on
She never meant to come back home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
Momma's gone
Good-bye to daddy"

Yes I see God where the mountains reach the sky
And I see God when the eagle starts to fly
I see God in a little baby's smile I see God and he makes my life worthwhile
Yes I see God when the bridegroom meets his bride
I see God in a father's loving eyes
I see God when a mother starts to cry I see God in a love that never dies

(I see God) when the little children play
I see God and I know he's near all way

"I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven oh what a beautiful sight
And I met all the stars in hillbilly heaven oh what a star spangled night
Last night I dreamed I went to hillbilly heaven
And just as I arrived the old curtain lifted
And there on stage stood who else but Roy Acuff and Tex Ritter
They said well how you doing come on in here
I know there's some folks you want to see
Over there's our newest member your old friend Conway Twitty say Hello Darlin'
And there's gentlemen Jim Reeves singin' with heaven's choir
Roger Miller he just got here he's making everybody laugh
Course you know Roy Orbison can sing just as high as anybody here
And Ernest Tubb can sing as low
And Patsy Cline well bet she's the best singin' angel here
And Dottie West is probably the prettiest
There's the old pea-picker Ernie Ford
Jimmy Rodgers George Morgan Hank Williams
And the wandering boy Web Pierce
The old honky tonker himself Lefty Frizzell
My goodness what a group
Would you just listen to Mother Mabel
Over there pickin' the Wildwood Flower with the angel band
You know I personally think she's just about God's favorite
And Marty Robbins well he's still gettin' more encores than anybody else up here
Just like he used to down on earth
Yeah well there's Elvis they still call him the King
But we know they're not talking about the real king up here
I dreamed I went to hillbilly heaven oh what a star studded night
Then I ask Roy and Tex I said well who do you think will be showin' up
Say within the next 40 50 60 years
They handed me a big tallybook and in it I saw names like Johnny Cash
George Jones Merle Haggard Don Gibson Mel Tillis Farren Young Kitty Wells
Some of the newer ones like Vince Gill and Garth Brooks
Course they talked about Minnie Pearl the Judds Tanya Tucker Reba McEntire Hank Jr
Oh of course Buck Owens Roy Rodgers Gene Autry Randy Travis and Willie Nelson
There's old Chet
I said well where's Porter Wagoner's name oh there it is
And then there was Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette and Dolly Parton
Oooh that's when I woke up
I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven oh what a beautiful sight
And I met all the stars in hillbilly heaven oh what a star spangled night"

It ain't fair for you to leave me cold and cryin' in the night
It ain't fair to take your body from my arms and out of sight
It ain't fair you've gone and left me where you kissed me I still burn
Are you leaving for my loving this awful hurt and then return
It ain't fair for you to leave me alone to face the morning light
It ain't fair you took my body and then to say that it ain't right
It ain't fair you've made me your woman a no longer a good girl in your eyes
How come before you said you'd love me it ain't fair that it ain't right
It just ain't fair that it ain't right"
"They say a woman's a fool for weeping
A fool to break her own heart
But I can't hold the secret I'm keeping
I'm breaking apart
Can't seem to mind my own business
Whatever I try turns out wrong
I seem like my own false witness
And I can't go on
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies
You told me you needed my company
And I believed in your flattering ways
You told me you needed me forever
Nearly gave you the rest of my days
Should've seen you for what you are
Should never have come back for more
Should've locked up all my silver
Brought the key right to your door
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies
You don't know what a chance is
Until you have to seize one
You don't know what a man is
Until you have to please one
Don't put your life in the hands of a man
With a face for every season
Don't waste your time in the arms of a man
Who's no stranger to treason
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies"

"Two little children a boy and a girl
Sat by an old church door
The little girl's feet
Were as brown as the curl
That fell on the dress that she wore
The little boy's cloths were all tattered and torn
They shown beneath his blue eyes
Why don't you go home
To you mommy I said
And this was the maddens reply
Mommy's in heaven
Angels took her away
Left Tim and I all alone
We've no one to love us
And daddy is dead
And our darling mother is gone
Mommy got sick
Angels took her away
To dwell in those mansions so bright
She said she would come
For her children some day
And I guess she's coming tonight
The sexton came early
To ring the church bell
And found them
Beneath the snow white
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell
Up in heaven with their mommy that night"
"They say the love 'bove will get you at the age of twenty-three
Well I'm not tellin' my age but something got a hold on me
I'm just cravin' some lovin' in the old fashion way
Honey linger near and listen to all I had to say
Why don't you haul off and love me one more time
Why don't you squeeze me until I'm turning blind
If you don't cuddle off and love me like I want you to do
I'm gonna haul off and die over you
[ steel ]
I can feel your warm lips near me hear you breathe so soft and fine
I can feel the matrimony crawling up and down my spine
I don't believe this love will hurt you cause it feels so nice and kind
It seems mighty close to heaven when your love is on the line
Why don't you haul off and love me...
I'm a gonna haul off and die over you"
"AFRAID TO LIVE AND AFRAID OF DYING
WITH PORTER WAGONER

They say most anything you eat could hurt your health
Be careful what you drink, don't harm yourself
And pollution in the air might make you sick
Makes you afraid to live, afraid that you might die too quick
Do the men that quote this danger really know
Life is gift to be enjoyed and not to worry so
The biggest danger sign that we should know
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go
We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'
And afraid to love the one we love, afraid they might be lyin'
We can't enjoy life when they say each thing might bring an early grave
We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'
Do the men that quote this danger really know?
Life is gift to be enjoyed, why worry so?
The biggest danger sign that we should know
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go"
"We'd get up before sun-up to get the work done up
We'd work in the fields till the sun had gone down
We've stood and we've cried as we have bristly watched
A hailstorm a' beatin' our crops to the ground
We've gone to bed hungry many nights in the past
In the good old days when times were bad
Chorus:
No amount of money could buy from me
The memories that I have of then
No amount of money could pay me
To go back and live through it again
I've seen daddy's hands break open and bleed
And I've seen him work till he's stiff as a board
An' I've seen momma layin' in suffer and sickness
In need of a doctor we couldn't afford
Anything at all was more than we had
In the good old days when times were bad
We've got up before and found ice on the floor
Where the wind would blow snow through the cracks in the wall
And I couldn't enjoy then, havin' a boyfriend
I had nothing decent to wear at all
So I long for a love that I never had
In the good old days when times were bad
Repeat chorus

"Momma moved out
Daddy sold the house
They split up the money
And went on their way
And all the king's horses
And all the king's men
Couldn't put mommy and daddy back together again
Starting over again
Where should they begin
Cause they've never been out on their own
Starting over again
Where do you begin
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And the whole world cries
Got an apartment
She moved in with her sisters
He's scheming big deals with one of his friends
While she sits at home
Just sorting out pieces
Of left over memories
From thirty odd years
Starting over again
Where do you begin
You've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
What will the neighbors say?
They're talking talk, it's small town news
Facing fifty years old
Making up a happy home
And this far down the road
You find yourself alone
Two fools
Starting over again
Now where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And all the king's horses
And all the king's men
Could never put mommy and daddy back together
Back together, again"
"Sugar pie honey bunch you know that I love you
I can't help myself I love you and nobody else
Wanna tell in and out my life you come and go
Leaving just your picture behind
and I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your finger or wink your eye I come a running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings and there's nothing I can do
Sugar pie honey bunch I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you tell you that we're through and I've tried
But every time I see your face I get all choked up inside
When I call your name girl it starts the flame burning in my heart
tearin it all apart no matter how I try my love
I cannot hide 'cause"

I would spin for you a blanket
Out of gold and silver threads
I would let my gentle bosom
Be a pillow for your head
I'd caress your perfect body
On a rosy bed at night
Play you love songs on a golden harp
And sing you Butterflies
In a diamond-studded chalice
On an emerald-plated tray
I would bring to you sweet nectar
And gifts of bright array
I would paint for you a castle
In a blue and yellow sky
Paint you happy ever after
And paint you Butterflies
Butterflies, my heart flutters with the notion
I get high on the wings of sweet emotion
Darling I, I just think of you and I get butterflies
I get close to you and I get butterflies
If only I were magic
I would make the wishes true
I would wave a magic wand
And be in Paradise with you
But I'm just a girl that loves you
I will love you all my life
But I do have a magic feeling
And it gives me butterflies
Butterflies, my heart flutters with the notion
I get high on the wings of sweet emotion
Darling I, I just think of you and I get butterflies
We should fly away together, you and I
Off to paradise forever, I get high
I get close to you and I get butterflies
I think of you and I get butterflies
I will spin for you a blanket out of gold and silver threads
If only I were magic, I would make the wishes true
I would wave a magic wand and be in paradise with you"
"There is a house down in New Orleans
Down in the Vieux Carr'e
A house they call the rising sun
Where love and money are made
My father he was a gambler
Mother died when I was young
And I've worked since then
To please the men
At the house of the rising sun
There is a house
Down in New Orleans
They call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh God, you know I'm one
So mothers you go telling all your daughters
Not to do what I've done
To live a life of sin, shame and strife
In the house of the rising sun"

Well I remember when I was just little
Mama used to cook on an old black kettle
On an old wood stove she'd had since she was wed
Well the oven door was sprung a little bit
So we propped it up with a forked stick
But that didn't matter cause Mama kept us fed
My mama and daddy must have loved each other
Cause I had eleven sisters and brothers
And the girls worked just as hard as the boys did
There was corn to hoe then we'd go hoe it
We might have been poor but we didn't know it
We'd heard that word but we didn't know what it meant
Oh we used to have such a good life
And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known
And oh didn't we have such a good time
It's sad to think the old black kettle's gone
Well there was nothing that pleased us any better
Than when we got an occasional letter
From kin folks livin' up north in some big town
We'd think of all the games we'd play
And we just couldn't hardly wait
When our city cousins said they'ze a comin' down
Now Mama's done away with the old black kettle
She used to cook in when I was just little
And the door ain't sprung on her electric range
That little farm and home we had
It ain't there no more and that's too bad
Folks are doin' away with the simple things
And oh we used to have such a good life
And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known
And oh didn't we have such a good time
It's sad to think the old black kettle's gone"

And we're gonna be alright
'Cause I like to know just where I stand
I don't like guessing games
And I hate a bunch of gibberish
So just spit it out real plain
Don't use big educated words
From your BS Degree
Straight talk, straight talk
Don't try bossing me
Straight talk, straight talk
Turn loose and let it go
You can tell me anything
Just like on Oprah's show
Just tell me how you really feel
Be on the up and up
With questions I can understand
For answers you can trust
Pick up the 'phone, you're not alone
We've all got something to say
So listen in and listen up
We'll find a better way
With honesty and common sense
It's really hard to miss
Straight talk, straight talk
Just tellin' it like it is
Straight talk, straight talk
There's nothing like the truth
Just tell me all your troubles
Pretend I'm Donahue
So don't be shy, 'cause we can talk
You know you've got a friend
Call me, call me
For simple straight talkin'
What's cookin', America?
Straight talk, Straight talk
Straight talk, Straight talk
So come on let's talk turkey
Just straight and to the point
About passions, about problems
About noses out of joint
Now I want you all to know
I care and I do understand
And hey, thanks for lending me an ear
Out there in radio land
Give me some straight talk, straight talk
Don't sugar coat it please
Straight talk, straight talk
Sounds sweet enough to me
But don't talk to me in circles
In your mumbo-jumbo jive
Straight talk, straight talk
And we're gonna be alright
Straight talk, straight talk
Makes plenty sense to me
Don't talk to me in circles
In your mumbo-jumbo jive
Gimme just straight talk, straight talk
And we're gonna be alright
Gimme just straight talk, straight talk
And we're gonna be alright"

You just wait and see
Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart

Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and see"

Let earth receive her king;
Let every heart prepare him room,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven and nature sing,
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing.
Joy to the earth! the savior reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods,
Rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.
No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make his blessing flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as the curse is found.
He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousness,
And wonders of his love,
And wonders of his love,
And wonders, wonders of his love."

Imagination runnin' hot, and you're right where you wanna be.
Do you think I'm made of stone?
Do you think it doesn't hurt when you leave me here alone,
Leaving me to think the worst?
And when you're out there in her arms 'til the wee hours of the dawn,
Do you think it's all a joke?
Can't you see my heart is broke?
Do you think I'm made of stone?
I'm just barely gettin' 'round,
Don't know how I'm getting by.
All our friends I meet in town,
They just can't look me in the eye.
They all know you're runnin' 'round.
Like me, they don't know what to do.
God, I hate their sympathy,
But I just can't turn loose of you.
But do you think I'm made of stone?
Don't you know my pain is real?
It's the worst I've ever known just stayin' at an even keel.
Oh, what am I supposed to do while you cheat and carry on?
I should leave, I know I should;
I just only wish I could.
Do you think I'm made of stone?
Oh, it cuts me like a knife,
You have stripped me of my pride.
What am I supposed to do while you cheat and carry on?
Do you think it's all a joke?
Can't you see my heart is broke?
Do you think I'm made of stone?"
"Got my eye on a boy
He's eyeing me back
It's looking real good
This could be it
And I know that all of you girls
Would love to steal him away
He bought me a drink
I thanked him real sweet
It's always so nice when you first meet
And I know that all of you women would love to steal him away
So I'm warning you
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Building up an appetite
You can look but you can't buy
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Pretty as a picture
Comin' on so strong
He's twisting my ignition key
Turn my motor on
But anyone can see, all his attention's on me
Give us some privacy
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
It's a welcome turn to try
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Leave us alone tonight
Then if it don't work out right
He's all your's
Until then
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
They keep crowdin' in on me
He smiles rather unsuspiciously
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Building up an appetite
You can look but you can't buy
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend"
"Love is strange
Lots of people take it for a game
Once you get it you never want to quit
After you've had it
You say love, love is strange
Is better than a kiss
When you leave me
Sweet kisses are a miss
Hey, you sexy thing
How do call your love girl?
I say love girl
And if she doesn't answer
I say you'd better come here love girl
And if she still doesn't answer
Well then it is
Baby love is strange, baby, baby ...
You are the one
Tell me something
How do you call your love boy?
I say come here love boy
Oh, but if he doesn't answer
I say, ah come here love boy
But what if he still doesn't answer
I simply say, baby, oh my baby
Come here like that
You're the one
What do you call your love girl, my sweet baby
How do you call your lover boy
You know all sorts of ways
Baby, my sweet baby
Oh my baby, you are the one"
"Oh the monkey's had a better tale than you
Compare to yours all their tales sound so true
The way you're actin' seems to me at all the monkey should go free
You're the one that should be locked up in the Zoo
When I married you I thought you were a man
But you're the biggest ape that's living in this land
I'd like to run you up a tree for the way you lie to me
Your swingin' round is gettin' out of hand
Oh the monkey's had...
Every monkey has its day so go ahead and play
Make your plans and tell your lies and stick to them
But from now on I remind you can wag your tail behind you
Cause you finally got yourself out on a limb
[ banjo ]
Every monkey has its day...
Oh the monkey's had a better tale than you"
"(Dolly Parton)
Walter, Walter Henry
I say Walter Henry Hagan
You done gone and broke my heart
Walter, Walter Henry
You know that I believed you
When you swore we'd never part
Well you said you had to have me
And well you dang well did
You took me from my country home
When I was just a kid
And you took me off to Boston
Put a baby on my knee
Left me to dangle-dingle
So far from Tennessee
Now Patrick might have been one
But you ain't been no saint
But a good ole' Irish boy
They say we'll always have this drink
And you just won't stop chasin'
All those other woman around
A' ramblin' and a'gamblin'
Throwin' Irish whiskey down
Walter, Walter Henry
Walter Henry Hagan
You don't listen when I call
Walter, Walter Henry
Of all the men I've ever loved
I loved you best of all
Oh play one for ol' Walter Henry boys
Walter, Walter Henry
Walter Henry Hagan
You done left your mark on me
Walter, Walter Henry
If you ever sober up
I'm waitin' back in Tennessee
If you ever sober up
I'm waitin' back in Tennessee
Walter, Walter Henry
Yoddle-le-ee-hee
Yoddle-le-ee-hee
Walter Henry Hagan
You done left your mark on me"
"Folks say my daddy wasn't much of a man
For disobeying the laws of the land
Folks say that my daddy wasn't fit to kill
Oh and I know it was true what the people said
Cause we'd all've been better of dead
Than to live a life of shame and strife
Cause of daddy's moonshine still
My mama was always sweet and kind
But she grew old before her time
Worryin' about the way we had to live
Yeah my daddy put the wrinkles in my mama's face
He drunk his share of all he made
And just one more reason I grew to hate
My daddy's moonshine still
Chorus:
Daddy's moonshine still was good for nothin'
But to break mama's heart
And to tear our home apart
Make our lives a livin' hell
Them old mason jars that daddy made us wash
And set them out to sun on our back porch
'Til he got ready to take 'em up on the hill
And when daddy got word of the revenue
He made us kids help hide his brew
Made us swear that we never knew
About daddy's moonshine still
Yeah and two of my brothers drove across the state line
Once a week with a load of moonshine
And the wounds that came from that won't ever heal
Cause on a moonshine run one rainy night
My two brothers lost their lives
And oh my god how I despise
My daddy's moonshine still
Repeat Chorus
Well it broke mama's heart but she understood
The day that I left home for good
But I had to find me another way to live
Well I sent mama money nearly every day
And how I made it, well I'd rather not say
But at least it took me far away
From daddy's moonshine still
My bootlegging daddy was known quite well
And he made our home a livin' hell
And I ain't forgot it and I know that I never will
My mama finally died she just gave up
And daddy finally died from drinkin' that stuff
And bad memories haunt the rest of us
From daddy's moonshine still
Repeat Chorus"
"In grave in my mind there are pictures mem'ries of a love I knew one time
So I find in my thoughts I stand looking
At the mem'ries hanging on the walls of my mind
I see a mem'ry of raindrops falling in the park on the day we met
Walking with each other through the rain laughing talking as we both got soak and wet
The mem'ry made that day I could never put away
That's the day he told me he'd be mine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
And I have a mem'ry of springtime cherry blossoms and bird singing on the vine
And the secret place we'd hide and laid together side by side
And the love that shined so brightly in his eyes
Springtime I recall was the sweetest time of all
That's the season our hearts became entwine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
Through the spring and summer he loved me and his love died with autumn leaves
His love was the wild and restless kind
When he left he left with me so many memories
He left them hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
Mhm mhm hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
He left them hanging on my mind"
"(Dolly Parton)
We can't always both be right
We sometimes disagree
But you've got the right to speak your mind
An' it's the same with me
When the anger's at an end
And you want inside my arms again
All you have to do to make it right is just
Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Everything's gonna be alright
Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Let me know, let me know everything's alright
There are times when I should be strong
When I'm awfully weak
When the sudden blows of life have brought me to my knees
Woman needs a helpin' hand
Needs someone to understand
Needs the man she loves to help her stand, so
Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Everything's gonna be alright
Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Let me know, let me know everything's alright
And when the busy day is done
You lay by my side
You know exactly what it takes to keep me satisfied
You know exactly what I need and I always go to sleep in peace
Thanking God that you belong to me, so
Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Everything's gonna be alright
Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Let me know, let me know everything's alright"
"(Dolly Parton)
I like fancy, frilly things
High heeled shoes and diamond rings
Rag time bands and western swingin'
Sneakin' around with you
Well I like beer and rodeos
Detective books and dominos
Football games and Cheerios
And sneakin' around with you
Chorus:
Sneakin' around with you
Goin' around or two
Doin' what lovers do
Whenever they're sneakin' around
I like lots of cash on hand
And dirty jokes about the fuller-brush man
I like stuff I understand
Like sneakin' around with you
You know, I like a thrill that has no strings
Friendship that don't ever change
And laughter from the joy of things
And sneakin' around with you
Repeat Chorus
I like drive-in picture shows
Kissin' long and lovin' slow
Secret places lovers go
Whenever they're sneakin' around
Ooh I like the crazy things we try
And the sexy things we fantasise
Just makin' out in the broad day light
And sneakin' around with you
2nd Chorus:
Sneakin' around with you
Keepin' it all brand new
Gettin' the best of you
Whenever we're sneakin' around
Sneakin' around, that's all
I'm gonna lay down the law
Watchin' her rise and fall
An' lovin' our sneakin' around
We're just sneakin' around
Aw, we're just sneakin'"
"(M. Chapman)
I can't even begin to tell you
How I've been feelin' lately
But I have stumbled across something rare
And you use it to bait me
Something tells me go
Everyone says no, no, no
How can they be so cruel
When they tell me don't touch you
I tell them I'll die
In your red hot screaming love
In your red hot screaming love
If I'm losing my senses
They're lost in your deepest emotions
And the jets in my heart
They won't start till you set them in motion
Something tells me go
Everyone says no, no, no
How can they be so cruel
When they tell me don't touch you
I tell them I'll die"
"(Dolly Parton)
Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady
I was happy with my baby, I was such a lucky lady
Hey, lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady
Lucky lady, that's what I was, I was lucky to have his love
All a woman could wish for, he was that and so much more
He was mine and how I loved him before your hands ever touched him
Long before your temping eyes lured my baby from my life
Hey, hey, Lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady
Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady
I was happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady
Is it love or is it pleasure, do you know you've found a treasure
Are you only having fun, do you know the prize you've won?
If you don't want something lasting, if it's just the time you're passing
Lucky lady, give him up 'cause I do love him very much
Lucky lady, lucky lady, I was once the lucky lady
I was happy with my baby, I was such a lucky lady
Hey, lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady, you lucky lady
Hey, hey, Lucky lady, lucky lady, you are now the lucky lady
Are you happy with my baby, you know you're a lucky lady"
"When you're alone and life is making you lonely
You can always go downtown
When you got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know, downtown
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
And go downtown
Things'll be great when you're downtown
No finer place for sure, downtown
Everything's waiting for you
Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows, downtown
Or maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close, downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of the music that they're playin'
Making conversation while you're on the dance floor swayin'
Happy again
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
And go downtown
Where all the lights are bright, downtown
Waiting for you tonight, downtown
You're gonna be alright now
And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to guide them along
So maybe I'll see you there
You can forget all your troubles
Just forget all your cares
And go downtown
Things'll be great when you're downtown
Don't wait a minute more, downtown
Everything's waiting for you
Downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown, waiting for you tonight
Downtown, you're going to be alright now
Get on, get on, get on downtown
Downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown, waiting for you tonight
Downtown, you're going to be alright now
Get on, get on, get on downtown"
"Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your roof's too close at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You are the reason I'm traveling home
Don't think twice, it's alright
There ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
That night, I never know'd
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me want to change my mind and stay
We never did do much talking anyway
Don't think twice, it's alright, no
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright
But there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
Like you never did before
And there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
'Cause I can't hear you anymore
Well, I'm thinking and wonderin' all the way down the road
I once loved a man but that love grew old
I gave him my heart, but he wanted my soul
Don't think twice, it's alright
Walking down that lone lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound well I can't tell
But goodbye is too good a way, babe
So I'm gonna say thee farewell
But I ain't saying you treated me unkind
You could have loved me better, but no, I don't mind
But you just kinda sorta wasted my precious time
Don't think twice, it's alright, no
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright"
"(Dolly Parton)
If you hear me crying in the night
Pretend that you don't hear me it's alright
Don't ask me why I'm crying, please don't make a sound
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
And if you think I act a little strange
And you don't understand when I do things
Like running through the fields while the rain is pouring down
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
And even though you may not understand me
I hope that you'll accept me like I am
For there are many sides of me, my mind and spirit must be free
And I might smile when other folks would frown
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
I might go out chasing butterflies
And if I fail to catch one I might cry
And if you want me you might find me in the meadow walking 'round
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
I might be home and busy cleaning house
And in the middle of my work I might go out
And go play games with children at the playground
It makes me happy, and that's just the way I am
And even though you may not understand me
I hope that you'll accept me like I am
For there are childish sides of me
My mind and spirit must be free
I might smile when you think I should frown
I don't know why, it's just the way I am"
"(Dolly Parton)
I thought I saw the promise of forever in your eyes
I thought that I was sure of what I saw
You led me to believe that I was special in your life
So I left my heart wide open for the fall
I thought I'd found a safe and loving place inside your heart;
And I was warm and willing any time
The same soft lips that kissed me sweet were lying from the start
But I swear I thought your love was genuine
What a heartache you turned out to be
What a heartache, what a heartache,
Like a switchblade that cuts quick and deep
Oh, what a heartache, what a heart break,
Love ain't always what it appears to be
Oh, what a heartache you turned out to be
It just goes to show that you never can tell
'Cause I really thought that I knew you well
I still can't believe I could be deceived so easily
Are all these wishes I'm wishin' to myself
Just rusty coins in a wishin' well?
Wishes come true, they come false as well
It's too late for you and me
Oh, what a heartache you turned out to be
What a heartache, what a heartache,
Love is two-faced and easy to deceive
Oh, what a heartache, what a heartache,
What a mistake to think I could believe
What a heartache, what a heartache,
Like a switchblade that cuts quick and deep
Ooh, what a heartache you turned out to be
What a heartache, what a heartache,
What a heartache, what a heartache,
What a heartache.
Ooh, what a heartache you turned out to be
Ooh, what a heartache
Oh, what a heartache,
What a heart break you turned out to be"
"(Dolly Parton)
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Strangers meet and they willingly surrender
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
Almost went to Aspen but something told me no
I considered Mammoth but there wasn't enough snow
And I even thought of Gatlinburg but that seemed so far to go
So I headed up to Tahoe for a Christmas on the slopes
And I had fantasized about Christmas in this way
Curled up by a fireplace in a Tahoe ski chalet
With a fast talking lover and some slow burning wood
But even in my wildest dreams it never got this good and
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Change the radio and I'll turn the lights down dimmer
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
Strangers when we met, lovers as we leave
Christmas to remember, too good to believe
Don't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again
We'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind
And you've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Neath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
We loved and laughed and played and joked
Sang Christmas songs and talked to folks
Sleighed the fields and skied the slopes
Then to the lodge for dinner
But now it's time for us to go
As our hearts melt like chimney snow
There's just one thing I want to know
Can we do this next winter
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer
Oh! What a Christmas to remember
You've made this a Christmas to remember
Springtime feelin's in the middle of December
Though it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers
Oh! What a Christmas to remember"
"Now I've never stepped through the doors of a barroom or tasted the flavor of wine
And I've never danced to the songs on a jukebox or held someone that wasn't mine
But there's always the first time and if you don't change
Then I guess the first time can't be arranged can't be arranged
[ banjo ]
Now I've never dressed for the eyes of the stranger to sow seeds of lust in his mind
And I've never walked down backroad of temptation to leave dirty footprints behind
But there's always the first time..."
"(David McDade)
Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll fly away to you, if only pretending
We'll be like bluebirds do, the beautiful lie
The beautiful lie, the beautiful lie
Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll find my way to you, if I'm only pretending
And we'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie
We'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie"
"Momma moved out
Daddy sold the house
They split up the money
And went on their way
And all the king's horses
And all the king's men
Couldn't put mommy and daddy back together again
Starting over again
Where should they begin
Cause they've never been out on their own
Starting over again
Where do you begin
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And the whole world cries
Got an apartment
She moved in with her sisters
He's scheming big deals with one of his friends
While she sits at home
Just sorting out pieces
Of left over memories
From thirty odd years
Starting over again
Where do you begin
You've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
What will the neighbors say?
They're talking talk, it's small town news
Facing fifty years old
Making up a happy home
And this far down the road
You find yourself alone
Two fools
Starting over again
Now where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And all the king's horses
And all the king's men
Could never put mommy and daddy back together
Back together, again"
"Baby, won't you come out tonight
Just come up the hill 'cause there's a full moon on the risin'
Hey baby, can't you steal away
You know I really need to see you tonight
I just got word you was packin' it in
What's the matter, this old town got you crazy again
I can see the sad look in your eyes
But I don't know how to say goodbye
And tomorrow, you're gonna have your day
Take your wife and you're gonna run away
Baby, while I'm wailin'
You'll be sailin' like a hog across the bay singin'
Ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Baby, won't you come out tonight
Oh baby, won't you come out tonight
We'll run up the hill and we'll dance in the moonlight
Let me gaze into your eyes 'til we both go blind
Oh baby, can I see you tonight
I'm just tryin' to find a way to make it last
Good friends, they seem to slip away so fast
An' I know we're both headed down separate tracks
An' when ya' go, baby don't look back
There won't be no more sleepin' over on a Tuesday night
No more runnin' to the races for a dark horse at midnight
No more dancin' after hours, singin' in the showers
Or clingin' to each other in the soft mornin' light singin'
Ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
I'll meet ya' on the corner
And you'll be there at midnight
Oh baby, can you steal away
You know I really want to see ya' tonight
Ooo baby, can you come out tonight
We'll run up the hill and dance again in the moonlight
Oh baby, can you steal away
I really wanna see you tonight
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
Come up the hill, there's a full moon on the rise
Oh baby, can ya' steal away
Baby, won't ya' come out tonight"
"We've been a searching for the love that lost its feeling
That one time filled our hearts with fire with love revealing
We thought that love had gone never more to be returning
And the fire that we thought had gone out again is brightly burning
Oh we found it oh we found it yes we found it yeah we found it
Joy to love joy to love we found it
And the lights are way down low the fire of love is high
We found it yes we found it oh we found it oh we found it
Sweet love you and I
[ steel ]
Well I never seen a lovelight shine so bright no wonder we found it
Shining like a neon light with love all around it
It's nights like this with love's sweet bliss sprinkled all around it
We cried a while but now we smile hmm hmm we found it
Oh we found it oh we found...
Oh we found it oh we found..."

"I've been around for you, been up and down for you
But I just can't get any relief
I swallowed my pride for you, I've lived and lied for you
But you still make me feel like a thief
You've got me stealing your love away, 'cause you never give it
Peeling the years away, we can't relive it
I make you laugh and you make me cry, I believe it's time for me to fly
Time for me to fly, got to set myself free
That's how it's got to be
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly
You said we'd work it out, you said that you had no doubt
I thought we were really in love
Oh but I'm tired of holding on to a feeling I know is gone
I do believe I've had enough
I've had enough of the falseness of a worn out relation
Enough of this jealousy and intoleration
I wonder why I even try, I believe it's time for me to fly
Time for me to fly, I've got to set myself free
That's just how it's got to be
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly, time for me to fly
Time for me to fly, I've got to set myself free
That's just how it's got to be
I make you laugh and you make me cry
I believe it's time for me to fly
Time for me to fly
That's how it's got to be
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly"
"I can live in a mansion or a double-wide
Eat sushi raw or my catfish fried
Wherever I am, then that's where I belong
'Cause I'm quite content with who I am
And if you ain't, well, kiss my ham
Country is as country does and I'm country to the bone
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I always will be, that's for sure
Country born and country bred
Countrified and country-fed
A country heart and a country head
'Cause I'm country to the core
Now, I can drive a tractor or a Cadillac
I can fly first class or slum in the back
But I'll be the same ol' gal when I arrive
Oh I can wear denim or I can wear silk
Drink champagne or chocolate milk
Take the best or live with less, 'cause a country girl survives
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
And the way I'll be until they lay me low
Country born and country bred
I'm countrified and I'm country-fed
And I'll be that way 'til I'm country dead
'Cause I'm country head to toe
And what you see is what you get
Nothing's ever changed me yet
Nothing will, it's a pretty safe bet
'Cause I'm country through and through
Oh, that's country!
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I'll be until my dying day
I'm country born and country bred
Countrified and country-fed
And nothing done and nothing said can change my country ways
Nothing done and nothing said
Nothing's gonna change my country ways
I don't think so
Wouldn't change if I could
Country is as country does
It's the way I is and it's the way I was
Country born and country bred
I'm countrified and I'm country-fed, you know that
I'm country (she's country)
But now that don't mean I can't go to town!"
"Mama didn't always have those tears in her eyes
And daddy once was able to hold his head up high
But now I brought disgrace to my whole family
Now they cry, but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me
I loved a boy and then I found that he just lead me on
So in my hurt and bitterness
I let myself go alone
But all I did was hurt myself
And shame my family
And now they cry but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me
No I'm not worth
The salt in one tiny tear
Oh why have I brought shame
To the one I loved so dear
I'm so sorry that I hurt them
But they'll never know how sorry
And now they cry but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me
Yes now they cry, but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me"

"Precious memories, unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me
And the sacred scenes unfold
Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And those old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear
Precious memories
How they linger
How they ever flood my soul
Then, the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious memories
How they linger
How they ever flood my soul
Then, the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious memories"
"On a park bench on sunny afternoon
Sat a young boy and a girl bout seventeen
As we stood so closely by watched them hold each other's hand
On their faces love had written we're making plans
Then he said to her you're my guiding light
Then she said to him you make my whole world seem so bright
Then we saw their books of braille and that neither one could see
Then I thought how close they must be
Souch tenderness my eyes have never seen
Two young lovers both just in their teens
Though their world gives them no light they see much more than you and me
Don't you know how close they must be
Then a car stopped just a few steps away
And a voice said Jim and Jeannie it's time to go
With their hands still clutched so tight helping each other to the car
Can you imagine just how close they are
Don't you know how close they must be"
"(Dolly Parton)
In my mind I've made love to you often
But only in my mind can it be so
'Cause there's someone at home that's countin' on me
And if I did, I'm sure that he would know
Yes, he would know, yes, he could tell
For, he has loved me long enough to know me very well
And if I lied, he'd see it in my eyes
I know my guilt would show and he would know
But I must admit you're someone very special
And it would be so easy to let go
Makin' love to you could be so easy
But if I did, I'm sure that he would know
Yes, he would know, yes, he could tell
For, he has loved me long enough to know me very well
And if I lied, he'd see it in my eyes
I know my guilt would show and he would know
My conscience just won't let me make love to you
I know it would be sweet, but I just can't
When I go home to him I must be able
To look him in the eyes and say I ain't
'Cause he would know, yes, he could tell
For, he has loved me long enough to know me very well
And if I lied, he'd see it in my eyes
I know my guilt would show and he would know
He would know"
"No matter how you're tempted
Don't say yes to me
Don't make this night as smooth to lead me on
It's just that I'm so lonely and I need someone
I've been too lonely too long
Oh please be strong enough to refuse me
Before I let myself do something wrong
For down inside I'm not that kind of woman
I've been too lonely too long
Oh please don't take advantage of the situation
For I'm afraid that I'm too weak to resist temptation
When you're used to being loved
It's hard to live alone
I've been too lonely too long
I've been too lonely too long"
"(Dolly Parton)
Someday when I'm over you
And when I think I'm able to
Well, I might try to be
Your friend again
But your restless heart
And rovin' eyes
My jealousy, these endless fights
I've got to get out of your life
Or I will never mend
I guess I'll die a bit each day
But I'm always dying anyway
And I don't have the heart to
Stay, and I can't take the pain
I know we've tried to no avail
Our heaven now has
Turned to hell
The same old hurt
We know so well
And something's got
To change
We both know it's got to end
The passion's gone
It's just pretend
And one of us have got
To make the move
We might as well just give it up
We've lost respect and
There's no trust
And without this, there's
No real love
It's just some sad excuse
I guess I'll die a bit each day
But I'm always dying anyway
And there's nothing left but walk away
Ain't this a crying shame
A change of pace
A change of heart
A change of place
A place to start
And we'll be better off apart
Our only chance is change
And we never wil
But something has to change
But someday when I'm over you
And when I think I'm able to
Then I will try to be your friend again
But I don't want to see
Your face 'til then
Change, I need a change
I need a change
We need a change"
"(Dolly Parton)
The hills were alive with wildflowers
And I was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run, they just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place
Just a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out
So I uprooted myself from my home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
So the garden, one day, set me free
I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Just a wild rambling rose, seeking mysteries untold
No regret for the path that I chose
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Wildflowers don't care where they grow"
"Sometimes I think of you and tears fill my eyes
To think of the meaning youve given my life
Youve touched me in places no one ever reached
Youve given me reason and cause to believe
You are my rainbow, youve colored my life
And you are my sunshine, Im warm in your light
You are my fountain that never runs dry
Youre my inspiration, my reason to try
Ill love you til green grass turns lavender blue
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew
Til horses and chariots chase down the wind
Thats when Ill leave you, Ill love you til then
Ill love you til green grass turns lavender blue
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew
Til horses and chariots chase down the wind
Thats when Ill leave you, Ill love you til then
Ill love you til green grass turns lavender blue
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew
Til horses and chariots chase down the wind
Thats when Ill leave you, Ill love you til then
Thats when Ill leave you, yes
Ill leave you then
Ill need you til then
Ill love you til then"
"We're well known in every honky tonk in town
Not a night goes by that we don't make the rounds
People wonder why we choose to live this way
Why don't they ever stay at home I hear them say
But home is where the hurt is
Cause love doesn't live there anymore
Home is where the hurt is
That's why we don't stay at home much anymore
[ fiddle ]
What was once our happy home has come to be
A place to fuss and fight and disagree
Our lonely house with wall to wall regret
And these bright lights somehow help us to forget
Cause home is where the hurt is...
That's why we don't stay at home much anymore"
"Fighting soldiers from the sky
Fearless men who jump and die
Men who mean just what they say
The brave men of the Green Beret
1st Chorus:
Silver wings upon their chest
These are men, America's best
One hundred men we'll test today
But only three win the Green Beret
Trained to live, off nature's land
Trained in combat, hand to hand
Men who fight by night and day
Courage deep from the Green Beret
Repeat 1st Chorus
Delta Force and CIA
Marines and SOCOM clear the way
Covert missions now in play
Special OPS like the Green Beret
Repeat 1st Chorus
While back at home a young wife waits
Her Green Beret has met his fate
He has died for those oppressed
Leaving her this last request
2nd Chorus:
Put silver wings on my son's chest
Make him one of America's best
He'll be a man they'll test one day
So have him win the Green Beret
Have him win the Green Beret
Repeat 1st Chorus"

"I used to love it when roses would come.
The card always read, ""You're my number 1"".
But love never goes the way one supposes,
And I will forever hate roses.
You sent me roses, I thought it was nice.
Opened the card and it read, ""goodbye"".
You're movin' on as this chapter closes,
And I will forever hate roses.
I'll never see a rose from now on
That will not remind me that you're really gone.
Don't trust the rose for the danger it poses
I will forever hate roses.
The fragrance of roses will last throughout time.
Their beauty will linger, but not in my mind.
No, I'll love the daisies, the tulips, the posies,
But I will forever hate roses.
And I'll never see a rose from now own
That will not remind me that you're really gone.
Oh, and don't trust the rose for the pain it imposes.
I will forever hate roses.
Now you're movin' on as this chapter closes,
And I will forever hate roses.
Yes, I will forever hate roses."
"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white"

Yes now they cry, but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me"
"Downtown tonight, I saw an old friend, someone who
I use to take comfort from long before I met you
I caught a spark from his eyes of forgotten desire
With a word, or a touch, I could have rekindled that fire
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do
Flickering embers of love
I've known one or two
But old flames can't hold a candle to you
Sometimes at night, I think of old lovers I've known
I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone
Like stars in the night lost in the sweet light of dawn
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do
Flickering embers of love
I've known one or two
But old flames can't hold a candle to you
Old flames can't hold a candle to you
Mmmm"
"You packed in the morning
I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I miss you more
Than I missed you before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
Yes, you left me
Just when I needed you most
Now most every morning
I stare out the window
I think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me
'Cause I need you more
Than I needed before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
Yes, you left me
Just when I needed you most
You packed in the morning
I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I love you more
Than I loved you before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
You left me
Just when I needed you most
Oh, you left me
Just when I needed you most"
"There's a wreath on the door
She don't live here no more
As of today, she flew home
And we all gathered here
In sorrow and tears
It won't be the same with her gone
There's a place on the hill
That's peaceful and still
Where she'll sleep beside daddy again
The ole' family tree is shedding it's leaves
But we'll all met in heaven again
Chorus:
Oh, she's an angel
Let her fly, let her fly
She's gone home to glory
To her home in the sky
When God sees her comin'
Heaven's choir will smile
And sing, ""oh she's an angel, let her fly, let her fly
Ooh, she's an angel, let her fly""
She used to rock me when I was a child
Sing ""rock of ages"" and ""in the sweet bye and bye""
Her life wasn't easy, oh but how hard she tried
You know she's an angel, lord, so let her fly
Repeat chorus
Tag:
Let her fly
Ooh she's an angel, let her fly"
"There is a diamond inside of me
That lights up the sky of my soul
Where fell the diamond when I believed
That all of the hurt was my fault
[Chorus:]
I'm opening the heart door
Letting in the light
Opening the heart door
And giving life to me that died
You ended up so with that person
Who comes home too late from the bar
I ended up so when my courage
Could finally walk on its own
When I finally opened the door
[Chorus]"
"(Dolly Parton)
In my mind I've made love to you often

"When troubles surround us, when evils come
The body grows weak
The spirit grows numb
When these things beset us, God doesn't forget us
He sends us His love
On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove
When Jesus went down through the river that day
Well, he was baptized in the usual way
And when it was done
God blessed His son
He sent him His love
On the wings of a dove
On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove"
"If you ask me if I'm happy
For I have peace within
If I'm worried about tomorrow
When I reach my journey's end
I'm satisfied with my Jesus
When he knocks I let him in
He'll go with me through the valley
For I know he is my friend
[Chorus:]
Satisfied, Satisfied
No trouble can ever get me down
When my eyes shall close in death
With my Jesus I'll be at rest
Then you'll know I'm satisfied
When my friends all forsake me
When they turn me from their door
If they sow no seeds of kindness
Make the thorns in my path grow
It won't matter over yonder
When I reach the other side
I'm gonna sit down with my Jesus
And then you'll know I'm satisfied"

He is high and mighty
He is high and mighty
He is there and ever waiting
Reaching out to you and me
He is high and mighty
Oh, mighty is His power
Mighty is His love
He is high and mighty
He is there with the answers
Let us lift Him up
God loves you, did you know that?
Ain't it good to know he cares
If you're burdened down with troubles
Just go to Him in prayer
Say God, I'm just a seeker
I'm empty, scared and lost
Then lay your burdens down
At the foot of the cross
He said ye shall know the truth
And the truth shall set you free
He will guide and lead you
And fulfill every need
Nothing is impossible
If you have faith enough
So if you've lost direction
Stop and just look up
'Cause He is high and mighty
Ooh, mighty is His power, mighty is His love
He is high and mighty
He is life everlasting
Let us lift Him up
High and mighty
He is high and mighty
I believe, I do believe
That His love has set me free
I believe, I believe, I believe
He is high and mighty
Oh, mighty is His power, mighty is His love
He is high and He's mighty
It's a wonderful feeling
Let us lift Him up
He said if I be lifted up
He said if I be lifted up
What did He say?
He said if I be lifted up
I'll draw all the men unto me
Let's lift him higher, higher
Higher and higher each day
Let's lift Him up
'Cause He is high and He's mighty
And He has washed my sins away
'Cause He's high and He's mighty"
"As I look around the little house we were so happy in
I think of all the happy times we'll never see again
Then I break down and start to cry, the children ask what for
I can't find a way to tell them that daddy won't be home anymore
Each night before they go to sleep they fold their little hands
And say a prayer for daddy fighting in their far-off land
So tonight I'll help them say their prayers like I've always done before
God give me courage to tell them that daddy won't be home anymore
But honey, as for me there'll never be another man
And I'll bring our children up the best way that I can
You died for what you thought was right that much I know for sure
But the children just can't understand why daddy won't be home anymore
No, the children just don't understand why daddy won't be home anymore"
"A cross between a movie star
And a hero in a book
Romeo comes struttin' in
And everybody looks
'Cause he's just got that special thang
That everybody needs
And everybody wants him
But not as bad as me
Hey, Romeo, where art thou
Get out here on the floor
I want to dance you darlin'
'Til you forget wherefore
Let's two step to a new step
We'll keep it all in line
And we'll call this the Romeo
'Cause you're so mighty fine
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo come dance with me
And that sexy little body
Beats all I've ever seen
I ain't never seen a cowboy
Look that good in jeans
My temperature keeps risin'
Every time we meet
I may not be in love
But let me tell you
I'm in heat
Romeo, Romeo, I just know I'll get you yet
Romeo, Romeo, I want to be your Juliet
So step it high, step it low
Step it out and in
Step to the side and let it slide
Then steppin' up again
Step on toes, it all goes
Steppin' as you please
But I'm one step away from love
So don't step out on me
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo with the magic feet
So step it high, step it low
Step it out and in
Step to the side and let it slide
Then steppin' up again
Step on toes, it all goes
Steppin' as you please
But I'm one step away from love
So don't step out on me
Romeo, Romeo
I just know I'll get you yet
Romeo, Romeo
Won't you be my Juliet
Romeo, Romeo
Romeo, Romeo
(Fade & Repeat)"
"(Bill Owens)
I'm running out of love and I'm running out of patience
You seem to get worse every day
I'm running out of love, better learn to resist temptation
Or someday you'll wake up and I'll be far away
How long did you think you could keep on doing me wrong
How long did you think I'd stay quiet and take it
The love I had for you is almost gone
And I ain't gonna let you take my heart and break it
I'm running out of love and I'm running out of patience
You seem to get worse every day
I'm running out of love, better learn to resist temptation
Or someday you'll wake up and I'll be far away
You come and go just any time you want to
And you never bother to tell me where your going
And I wonder if there's anything you don't do
Someday you'll pay for the wild seed your sewing"
"Two people, together
It was just a dream until you came along
My heart was waiting just for you
Tomorrow, forever
We both heard these promises for far too long
And now you make the words come true
So touch me now
I need to have you close tonight
And show me how
You can me feel this way
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key
Can't keep it, a secret
Everything I feel is written on my face
I can't hide my heart from you
You hold me, is magic
In your arms the world becomes a better place
Now I know what love can do
Here we go
Exactly where the road will lead us
I don't know
I just know that you'll be there
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key
And whenever you, I'm there
Every stumble and fall, I share
I'll be yours through it all
Coz I care, about you baby
It's so easy to see, so strong
Now I know you and me, belong
I'll be by your side forever....
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key"
"Love is strange
Lots of people take it for a game
Once you get it you never want to quit
After you've had it
You say love, love is strange
Is better than a kiss
When you leave me
Sweet kisses are a miss
Hey, you sexy thing
How do call your love girl?
I say love girl
And if she doesn't answer
I say you'd better come here love girl
And if she still doesn't answer
Well then it is
Baby love is strange, baby, baby ...
You are the one
Tell me something
How do you call your love boy?
I say come here love boy
Oh, but if he doesn't answer
I say, ah come here love boy
But what if he still doesn't answer
I simply say, baby, oh my baby
Come here like that
You're the one
What do you call your love girl, my sweet baby
How do you call your lover boy
You know all sorts of ways
Baby, my sweet baby
Oh my baby, you are the one"
"I wish I could forget you, but I won't
I wish I loved another, but I don't
It's just the same, day after day
Your memory keeps getting in my way
But I'm hoping I will be alright
But I don't even sleep at night
I close my eyes I see your face
Your memory keeps getting in my way
I don't know why I can't forget you
I don't see why I should let you
Keep messing up my mind with all those thoughts of yesterday
Your memory keeps getting in my way
It's easy for someone to lie
I'm saying I'll forget you and I'll try
Here's hoping that I will someday
Your memory keeps getting in my way
I don't know why I can't forget you
I don't see why I should let you
Keep messing up my mind with all those thoughts of yesterday
Your memory keeps getting in my way"
"(Dolly Parton/Dorothy Jo Hope)
In this mental institution, lookin' out through these iron bars
How could he put me in here, how could he go that far
Yes I need help but not this kind, he didn't love me from the start
But it's not my mind that's broken, it's my heart
Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you
I'm depending on you Daddy, there's nothing I can do
And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need
But Daddy I can't come to you, you'll have to come to me
When he said he loved another, I was crazy with jealousy
That's 'cause I was crazy over him and I couldn't stand to set him free
And I couldn't stand to lose him and I cried and cried for days
And he said that I was crazy but he just put me in here to get me out of his way
Daddy come and get me
Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you
I'm depending on you Daddy 'cause there's nothing else I can do
And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need
But Daddy I can't come to you, you'll have to come to me"
"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
[Chorus]
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town"

Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll fly away to you, if only pretending
We'll be like bluebirds do, the beautiful lie
The beautiful lie, the beautiful lie
Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll find my way to you, if I'm only pretending
And we'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie
We'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie"
"The crops are all in and the peaches are rotting
The oranges are piled in their creosote dumps
You're flying them back to the Mexican border
To pay all their money to wade back again
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis a-mi-gos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be deportee
Some of us are illegal and some of us are not wanted
Our work contract's out and we have to move on
But it's 600 miles to that mexican border
They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like thieves
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis a-mi-gos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be deportee
My father's own father, waded that river
They took all the money he made in his life
My brothers and sister come work the fruit trees
They rode the truck til' they took down and died
The airplane caught fire over Los Gatos canyon
A fireball of lightning that shook all our hills
Who are these dear friends all scattered like dry leaves
The radio said they were just deportees
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis a-mi-gos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be deportee
No, all they will call you will be deportee
All they will call you will be deportee"
"Oooh,OOh,Oooh-ooh,Oh,Oh,Oh,Oh-oh-oh-oh.
Well, I can't tell you where I'm going
I'm not sure of where I've been
But I know I must keep travelin'
Till my road comes to an end
I'm out here on my journey
Trying to make the most of it
I'm a puzzle I must figure out
Where all my pieces fit
Chorus
Like a poor wayfairing stranger
That they speak about in song
I'm just a weary pilgrim
Trying to find what feels like home
Well, that is no one can tell me
Am I doomed to ever roam
I'm just travelin' travelin' travelin'
I'm just travelin' on.
Questions I have many
Ansewers but a few
We're here to learn the spirit burns
To learn the greater truth
We've all been crusified
And they nailed Jesus to the tree
And when I'm born again
You're gonna see a change in me
God made me for a reason
And nothing is in vain
Redemption comes in many shapes
With many kinds of pain
Oh, sweet Jesus if you're out there
Keep me ever close to you
As I'm stumbling tumbling
As I'm traveling through
I'm just traveling traveling traveling.
I'm just traveling through ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
I'm just traveling traveling
I'm just traveling through ooho ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Oh sometimes the road gets rugged
And it's hard to travelin' on
But hold in to each other
We don't have to work alone
When everything is broken
We can mend it if we try
We can make the world a difference
If we want to we can fllly.
Good-bye you little children
Good-night you handsome men
Farewell to all you ladies
And to all who knew me when...
And I hope I'll see ya down the road
You meant more than I knew
As I'm travelin' travelin' travelin' travelin' travelin' through
Drifting like a floating boat
And roaming like the wind
Oh give me some direction lord
Let me lean on you
As I'm travelin' travelin' through (Repeat, Repeat)
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like the poor wayfaring stranger
That they speak about in song
I'm just like a weary pilgrim
Tryin' to find my own way home
Oh, sweet jesus if you're out there
Keep me ever close to you
As I'm travelin' travelin' travelin' through
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh travelin' through."
"(Dolly Parton)
The hills were alive with wildflowers
And I was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run, they just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place
Just a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out
So I uprooted myself from my home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
So the garden, one day, set me free
I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Just a wild rambling rose, seeking mysteries untold
No regret for the path that I chose
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Wildflowers don't care where they grow"
"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you"
"I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on
I've traveled around this country crossed the waters deep and wide
Made lots of friends and memories brought joy to other's lives
It's Christmas time again another year has come and gone
And I can't keep from wonderin' how the old folks are at home
I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on
When the snow is on the meadow and the sleigh bells jingle bright
And the kids are singing jingle bells around the Christmas lights
As daddy stokes the fire and mama puts the turkey on
There ain't nothing going to slow me down this Christmas I'll be home
I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on"
"I just want to be somebody's everything.
You say I've seen too many movies, watched too much TV,
Read too many fairy tales that I live and make believe.
You say the kind of love I'm dreamin' of does not exist.
And there's no one like I'm searchin' for, well, I believe there is.
And I want someone to come alive when they lay eyes on me,
Have a lust within their touch, a passion fire beyond belief.
Reality and fantasy should be one in the same
And I want to be somebody's everything.
I refuse to settle for something less than great.
And if it takes a lifetime, then that's how long I'll wait.
'Cause all I want is everything, is that too much to ask?
Have romance, love and passion; find magic that will last.
And I want someone to think they'll die if they can't be with me.
I want to be their joy, their pride, their dreams,
The very air they breathe.
I want to wake up feelin' loved and go to bed the same.
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything, somebody's everything.
Oh, I want someone to come alive when they lay eyes on me.
Have a lust within their touch, a passion fire beyond belief.
I'd love to wake up feelin' loved and go to bed the same.
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything.
Someone to hold me close and tremble when the lovin's done.
Think it's heaven, call me angel, think I hung the moon and sun.
Get misty eyed just knowin' with a love song people sing.
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything.
And I'm gonna be somebody's everything,
somebody's everything.
I want to be, I'm gonna be somebody's everything.
I want to be, I want to be somebody's everything,
Somebody's everything, somebody's everything
Somebody's everything, somebody's everything
Yes I want to be, I'm gonna be somebody's everything
I want to be, I'm gonna be, I wanna be somebody's everything"
"It's you that
I run to
Whenever I need to
Darling, you console me
When trouble surrounds me
When bad times have found me
Just reach out your arms and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Darling please take me
In your arms of safety
Reach out your arms
And hold me
Hold me
When my feelings are showing
When my tears are flowing
Just reach out
Reach out and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
You know all of my needs
You fill them completely
You know
That you control me
I depend on
Your lovin'
Without you
I'm nothin'
So reach out
Your arms and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Darling please take me
In your arms of safety
Reach out you arms
And hold me
Hold me
When life is demanding
When I need understanding
Reach out
Reach out and hold me
Hold me
Hold me"
"Just because all my dresses are just cotton hand me downs
His family calls me the lower class
Cause we're only poor folks on the other side of town
They won't let him walk up my path
But my mama says don't worry when they say those things about you
You remember, you're just as good as him
Just because they got that big house sittin' way upon the hill
Why, you don't have to look up to them
We've got chicken every Sunday and the preacher comes around
And every Saturday morning daddy takes us all to town
And we'd go to the picture show, have picnics on the ground
Oh, that's the lower class then I'm glad that's what I am
Cause my mama don't belong to the ladies social set
My daddy can't afford the country club
His folks look down on me and they don't let us date
Cause they think that I'm not good enough
But my mama says forgive him honey, he ain't worth at all
And if anything, you're too good for him
Just because they've got money and a big fine house
Aha, we won't take no sad talks off them
We've got chicken every Sunday and the preacher comes around
And every Saturday morning daddy takes us all to town
And we'd go to the picture show, have picnics on the ground
Oh, that's the lower class then I'm glad that's what I am
We've got chicken every Sunday and the preacher comes around
And every Saturday morning daddy takes us in to town"
"I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at'all
So tell me why should it be true?
That I get a kick out of you
Some people go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
Still I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you
Standin' there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously don't adore me, aww
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothin' to do
Still I get a kick out of you
Yes I get a kick out of you"
"Sacred mem'ries often take me to the place where I grew up
And that little country church that I love so much
I used to go there every time that old church bell would ring
And I remember how I love the songs we used to sing
Like oh Lord you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home oh Lord what will I do
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
They were singing Lord I'm coming on when I got saved
And when I got baptized they sang amzaing grace
And oh how sweet the sound when everybody would join in
And sang my favorite song if we never meet again
Where the charming roses bloom forever and where separation comes no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven I will meet you on that beutiful shore
My mama loved to sing and she sang clear and loud
I can close my eyes and I hear mama now
I recall the song my mama always loved so much
She always sang the loudest sangin' power in the blood
Oh there's power power wonder working power in the blood of the lamb
There is power power wonder working power in the precious blood of lamb
Sacred mem'ries"
"I can still see that lonesome road stretched out before me
The road that left me out of his love
I can still feel the tears he cried on my shoulder the day that I told him goodbye
I never should have left him never should have gone oh what a crazy fool I've been
Will he be waiting for me he will be won't he and will he take me back again
Shadows from the streets shade the path that I am walking
As I make my way back up that winding road again
And the smell of my tomorrow fills the air with sweet perfume
My heart beats faster as I'm near my journey're end
I wonder if he's missed me I wonder if he wants me I wonder does he love me still
Will he be waiting for me he will be won't he oh how I hope he will
He will be waiting for me he will be won't he
How could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me he will be won't he
Oh will I find that this time I'll be the one to cry
Will he be waiting for me"
"I'm a little bit slow to catch on
When I do I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on
Well, I couldn't see the light for the brightness
Of the sweet little smile you gave me
I couldn't see how you were cheatin' on me
But finally I'm a catchin' on, on
Finally, I'm a' catchin' on
I'm a little bit slow to catch on
When I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on
I couldn't see the hurt for the happy
And at first that's the way you made me
It took me a while to get your style
But finally I'm a' catchin' on, on
Finally I'm a' catchin' on
I'm a little bit slow to catch on
When I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on
You say you can't see the light for the darkness
That surrounds you since I'm gone
You can't eat or sleep 'cause you're lonely
Well, finally you're catchin' on, on
Finally you're a' catchin' on
I'm a little bit slow to catch on
When I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on
I'm a little bit slow to catch on
When I do, I'm a caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on"

Walter, Walter Henry
I say Walter Henry Hagan
You done gone and broke my heart
Walter, Walter Henry
You know that I believed you
When you swore we'd never part
Well you said you had to have me
And well you dang well did
You took me from my country home
When I was just a kid
And you took me off to Boston
Put a baby on my knee
Left me to dangle-dingle
So far from Tennessee
Now Patrick might have been one
But you ain't been no saint
But a good ole' Irish boy
They say we'll always have this drink
And you just won't stop chasin'
All those other woman around
A' ramblin' and a'gamblin'
Throwin' Irish whiskey down
Walter, Walter Henry
Walter Henry Hagan
You don't listen when I call
Walter, Walter Henry
Of all the men I've ever loved
I loved you best of all
Oh play one for ol' Walter Henry boys
Walter, Walter Henry
Walter Henry Hagan
You done left your mark on me
Walter, Walter Henry
If you ever sober up
I'm waitin' back in Tennessee
If you ever sober up
I'm waitin' back in Tennessee

"You think you're so smart you think that you'd throw my heart
Don't at your feet every time that you walk by
But I, I got news for you cause I don't care for you and
I don't care honey if you love me or not
If you were half as smart as you think you are
The world would be a-standing at your door
But I, I won't be there cause I no longer care and
I don't want you around me anymore
Because you can't have your way you tell me every day
I should grow up stop acting like a child
But I, I think its you that's got some growing to do
And honey I think its gonna take you quite a while
If you were half as smart as you think you are
The world would be a-standing at your door
But I, I won't be there cause I no longer care and
I don't want you around me anymore"
"(Dolly Parton/Floyd Parton)
I used to stand on a corner when I was a child
And I'd play my guitar and sing as the people went by
The sidewalks were crowded but I'd just sing louder cause I didn't mind
Just spending my time, spinning my rhymes and singing for nickels and dimes
Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes
I'd brighten their day as they go on their way and they'd brighten mine
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind
I knew that someday in my own special I'd repay all their nickels and dimes
I recall the sidewalk each night as I stand on the stage
As I play my guitar and sing for the people who paid
Cause I finally made it to what they all call the big time
But I still remember I still owe some nickels and dimes
Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind
So if you remember a child on the corner of time
You'll know that I wrote this to repay your nickels and dimes
Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind
So if you remember a child on a corner of time
You'll know that I wrote this to repay your nickels and dimes
Nickels and dimes a song at a time for nickels and dimes
A sidewalk rehearsal for dreams that I held in my mind
So if you remember a child on a corner of time
You'll know that I wrote this to repay your nickels and dimes"

Don't ask me if I'm crying
Can't you see it ain't raining
No, this ain't sand in my eyes
Before it has been spoken
When one good heart gets broken
That's enough to make a cowgirl cry
Cause here I am, all by myself
My man he just up and left
He said he would never try again
Now the thing that hurts me most
When he makes up his mind to go
He'll be gone, like a wild texas wind
Chorus:
Like a wild texas wind
Oh my man is gone again
I feel lonesome settin' in
Like a wild texas wind
Like a Wild Texas Wind
Oh my man is gone, he's gone, he's gone again
I feel lonesome sittin' in
Like a wild texas wind
Hmmmm"
"Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
I guess I should have known the worst was yet to come
And the crying time for me had just begun
Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again
Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again"
"With great anticipation he waited at the door
His only son was due from overseas
For months now he'd been waitin' since he'd gone off to war
And his eyes were filled with tears of great relief
Welcome home, son
His loving arms held open and his heart so full of love
Welcome home, son
I've been prayin' and been hopin' and I never did give up
I knew that you'd return to me
The place where you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long.
I hear him say as they embrace
""I've waited so long for this day
My son, my very own... Welcome home.""
But a dreary rain was falling while another soldier fell
And a mother wakes up crying in the night
She thought she'd heard him calling in that moment she could tell
Her only son had passed into the light
Welcome home, son
His loving arems held open and his heart so full of love
Welcome home, son
As Jesus stood there glowing, their hands reached out and touched
I knew that you'd return to me
The place that you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long
As they embraced I heard him say
""I've waited so long for this day
My son, my very own... Welcome home.""
Now I think of all the families that have lost a darling one
And I think how Jesus died for all our sins
And I think how much God loved us to send his only son
To live and die, and then to live again
Welcome home son
I hear God saying when they nailed Christ to the cross that day
Welcome home son
And when he sent his angels to roll that stone away
I knew that you'd return to me
The place where you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long
I hear God say as they embrace
""I've waited so long for this day
Well done my faithful son... Welcome home.""
Welcome home!
I hope to hear God saying when it's my time to go!
Welcome home!
While the angel band is playing and God comes to claim my soul!
The angels will be singing and joybells will be ringing!
Rejoicing! I'll shout and sing along!
When there are no more wars to fight
And we're all children of the light
When the father and the son say
""Welcome home!""
Tag: Welcome home, welcome home, welcome home."
"It's funny how love goes
'Cause I know this could never work out
But honey, how love grows
Even though there's no reason to doubt
This can never be
You keep saying it's wrong
Neither one of us is free
Still I want to hold on
When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
Even a fool would let go
Love has no reason
Like the words in a song that don't rhyme
My love has no season
I just know that it's there all the time
Maybe just you and me
I can't believe that it's wrong
Thinking about you and me
Just makes me want to hold on
When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
Even a fool would let go"
"(Dolly Parton)
The greatest gift, the gift of life
The gift of love divine
God gave us all a special gift
He meant for it to shine
He meant for it to shine
The darkest night can be made light
By one bright word or smile
If we'd put on our neighbor's shoes
And choose to walk a mile
God gave us all our own free will
To choose the paths we take
No greater deed could e'er be done
Than for another's sake
The greatest gift, the gift of life
The gift of love divine
God gave us all a special gift
He meant for it to shine
He meant for it to shine
Shine on, shine on, for all to see
God's light inside your soul
Shine on, shine on, let love flow free
Warm others in its glow
Shine on, shine on, shine on
So hide it not or it will fade
Shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on, shine on
The greatest gift, the gift of life
The gift of love divine
God gave us all a special gift
He meant for it to shine
Shine on, shine on, shine on"
"Find the loneliest girl in a thousand find the saddest eyes you've ever seen
Find someone who's always longing for you find that man and you found me
And all I need is you all I want is you to give my loving to all I need is you
Find a man who wakes up every morning and lives in a world of make believe
Find someone who's arms are aching for you you find that girl and you found me
And all I need is you all I want is you to give my loving to all I need is you
You're with me now so let the world forsake us
I've found my heaven here within your arms
And nothing in this world can separate us you're all I ever wanted all along
And all I need is you all I want is you to give my loving to all I need is you"
"I don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you've promised
Beneath the halo moon
But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrows
While you play your cheatin' game
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind
You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind
You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine"
"Silent night holy night all is calm all is bright
Round young virgin mother and child holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar heavenly hosts sing hallelujah
Christ the Savior is born Christ the Savior is born
Silent night holy night son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face with the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at Thy birth Jesus Lord at Thy birth"
"You and me and her and him must get together
And see if maybe we can find a way
To put an end to hurting one another
Cause he don't know and she don't know how much we hurt each day
It's not fair and you and I both know it
To have to hide and love the way we do
The time is now that we must get together
Her and him me and you
[ steel - fiddle ]
She and I had lost it long before I met you
We tried and tried but all the love had gone
And I guess respect is all that's kept me with him
Cause there hasn't been no love there in so long
It's not fair and you and I both know it...
Her and him me and you"
"(Joe South)
Oh the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
Never saying what they mean
Oh they whine away the hours
In their ivory towers
Til they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Oh they make one another cry
Break their hearts and they say good-bye
Cross their heart and they hope to die
That the other was to blame
Neither one will ever give in
So they gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' 'bout the way it might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Oh they teach how to meditate
Read your horoscope and teach you faith
The furthermore the hell with hate
Come on and get on board
Look around and tell me what you see
What's a-happenin' to you and to me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play"
"(Buck Trent & George McCormick)
Suppose you wanted someone the way I want you
Just imagine your body, mind and soul breaking in two
Walk the floor each night, shed tears you can't conceal
Just try being lonely, then you'll know just how I feel
I saw you with your new love and oh it hurt me so
Funny how I see your face everywhere I go
You smiled and looked to be so happy as you passed by
So I hurried around the corner so you wouldn't see me cry
Suppose you wanted someone the way I want you
Just imagine your body, mind and soul breaking in too
Walk the floor each night, shed tears you can't conceal
Just try being lonely, then you know just how I feel
Just try being lonely, then you know just how I feel"
"Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far
That I'll lose track
Me, I'll bounce right back
Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine
Me, I'll be just
Fine and dandy

Sorrow bring me way down

"Before you make up your mind to leave me
Before you make up your mind to walk out the door
Before you telle me that it's all over
Let me say what I have to say it won't take me all day
And if you still wanna leave don't stay for I won't try to hold you anymore
Does she really love you way that I love you
Does she treat you right even when you've done wrong
If she's woman enough to forgive you way that I'm willing to
If she ain't then don't go for I still love you so we all make mistakes I know
Give these thoughts a little time before you make up your mind

Give these thoughts a little time before you make up your mind"
"(Dolly Parton)
I can still see that lonesome road stretched out before me
The road that led me out of his life
I can still feel the tears he cried on my shoulder
The day that I told him good-bye
I never should'a left him
Never should'a gone
Oh what a crazy fool I've been
Will he be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
And will he take me back again
He will be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
Or will I find that this time
I'll be the one to cry
Shadows from the trees
Shade the path that I am walkin'
As I make my way back up that windy road again
The smell of mountain laurel fills the air with sweet perfume
My heart beats faster as I near my journey's end
I wonder if he missed me
Wonder if he wants me
I wonder does he love me still
Will he be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
Oh how I hope he will
He will be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
Or will I find that this time
I'll be the one to cry
He will be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
Or could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me
He will be, won't he
Or will I find that this time
I'll be the one to cry
Cry, mmmm"

Shining like the sun
And the way his eyes burned into mine
I knew he must be the one

So I couldn't pull away
But the kind of lovin' that I gave to him
I'm not ashamed to say
Oh, as soon as I touched him
Soon as I touched him I felt like a woman
And the feelin' made me close my eyes
Soon as I touched I was born again
An' I heard myself cryin' like a new born baby cries
He told me what I meant to him
Swore that I was sent to him
All my lovin' went to him
Now he's gone, oh, he's gone
Now I hide myself from the light of day
So no one else can see
A part of him that I can't forget
That's growin' deep inside of me
Oh, as soon as I touched him
Soon as I touched him I felt like a woman
And the feelin' made me close my eyes
Soon as I touched I was born again

Soon as I touched him

"Precious memories, unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me
And the sacred scenes unfold
Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And those old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear
Precious memories
How they linger
How they ever flood my soul
Then, the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious memories
How they linger
How they ever flood my soul
Then, the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious memories"
"To know, know, know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
I'll be good to him
I'll bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him
Yes, just to know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
Why can't he see
How blind can he be
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me, ooh
To know, know, know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know him
Is to love love love him
And I do"

Get To Livin
Verse 1:
People always coming up to me,
And asking Dolly whats your secret?
With all you do your attitude just seems
To be so good how do you keep it?
Well am not the Dalai Lama but ill try,
To Offer up a few word of advice.
Chorus:
Youd better get to living, Givin
Dont forget to throw in a little forgiving
And lovin on the way.
Youd better get knowing, showing
A little bit more concerned about where youre going
Just a word unto the wise.
Youd better get to livin.
Verse 2:
A girlfriend came to my house,
Started cryin on my shoulder,
Sunday evening. (Better Get To Living)
Shes she was spinnin such a sad tale I couldnt believe
The yarn that she was waving
So negative the words she had to say,
I said If I had a violin Id Play
Chorus:
I said youd better get to living, give in
Be willing and forgivin
Cos our healin has to start with you.
You Better stop wining, pining,
Get your dreams in line and just
Shine, Design, Refine until They Come True.
And youd better get to living
Bridge:
Your lifes a wreck your house is a mess,
And your wardrobe is way outdated,
All your plans just keep on falling through,
Overweight and underpaid,
Underappreciated,
Am no guru but I tell you this I know is true
Chorus:
Youd better get to living, givin
A little more thought about been a little more willing,
To make a better way (make a better Way)
Dont sweat the small stuff, keep your chin up,
Just hang tough, and If it get too rough,
Fall on your knees and pray, and do that everyday
Then youll get to livin
Outro:
The day were born we start to die,
So dont waste one minute of this life,
Get to livin! (Get to livin)
Share your dreams and share your Laughter and Make some points.
For the great hereafter. (Get to Livin)
Better start caring,
Better start sharing
Better start tryin,
Better start smilin
And you better get to livin."
"(Dolly Parton)
I love you, I love you
My heart seems to whisper
But my lips cannot form those words
I know my heart
Is calling out to you
In a voice you've already heard
Does your heart feel as if
It could burst any second
Is it racing, will not slow up
Do you just want to be
With me endlessly
Well I'm thinking
We might be in love
We might be in love
The best I can tell
I thinkin' thoughts
That I've never pondered
And I'm feeling like I've never felt
It's like I drink
From some magic posion
Sipping from your loving cup
Intoxicated, infatuated
I'm thinking we might be in love
We might be in love
What else could it be
These feelings of wonder
Passion and romance
Excitement and pure ectasy
We might be in love
And it might be forever
I think there's a future for us
If you just want to be
In and all over me
It might be, we might be in love
I promise for keeps
If you're feeling like me
Then it might be
We might be in love
I dare say
We might be in love"
"(Porter Wagoner)
If I cross your mind, please let me cross it slowly
Let me stop and reminisce with you for a while
And if I cross your mind, please remember only good things
Think of me as happiness if I cross your mind
There must be a million thoughts rushing through your mind
And if there's one of me love, among them that you find
Please stop for just a little while and treat it extra kind
When you think of me love, if I cross your mind
If you must hide my memory when you're with someone else
Then make mine very special when you're by yourself
For only in a memory can one turn back the time
To lovely tender moments that linger in your mind
There must be a million thoughts rushing through your mind
And if there's one of me love, among them that you find
Won't you stop for just a little while and treat it extra kind
When you think of me love, if I cross your mind
Think of only good things if I cross your mind"

"I can hear the rippling water falling gently
From the waterfall that I have found
From the meadow I hear meadowlarks a singing
Seems there's sounds of nature all around
I can hear the wind go whistling through the treetops
I hear raindrops falling softly to the ground
In the distance I can hear the roar of thunder
Seems there's sounds of nature all around
Sounds of nature fill the air with music
How I love and cherish every sound
I often kneel in prayer to thank the Master
For the sounds of nature all around
In a barren tree a lonesome dove is calling
For its mate that's nowhere to be found
In the garden I hear honeybees a humming"
"Darling will your love be mine forever always always
Will you keep those vows we made together always always
Will your love be as strong
If my dreams should all go wrong always always
Darling will you stay with me forever always always
Will your love remain through stormy weather always always
Will your love be strong enough
To walk the roads that might get rough always always
In return for your love I'll be true as stars above always always
And the love that I feel will forever be so real always always"

Time passes by but still you can't forget her, it looks like you can't forget her
Oh and that makes me wonder if you'll ever, ever be mine
There's no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart

Yes that one in a million girl
And now with my loving arms around you

"If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my children and my wife
I'd thank my lucky stars
To be living here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.
From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston
And New York to L.A.
Well there's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me

And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land

"From the start I promised you that I would always be
Waiting here at anytime you ever needed me
I loved you then and I love you now as I always will
And I am always waiting willing to forgive
I'll be your shelter from the storm
My love will keep you safe and warm
I'm a harbor on your stormy sea you can always come to me
For I am always waiting
My arms are always open wide and I will dry the tears you cried
If you should ever need someone darling let it be me
I will mend your broken heart and I'll replace the missing parts
I am always waiting anytime you need me
I'll be your shelter from the storm...
For I am always waiting"
"There was a time we'd sit in the backyard cause the house would get so hot
From the summer sun there was no way of sleepin'
And you'd play your old guitar we'd fight mosquitoes and enjoyed
You backyard concerts for we had no television
We'd just begun our life as man and wife and hard ships then
Could scaresly scare us into quittin'
Things were far from bein' fine we often dined upon a dime
But there never was a time we didn't love
The Christmas brought us saddest days
When your pride gave a way you told the kids
There'd be no gifts cause we were broke
Though their little tears of grief was so hard to see it didn't hurt me
Like the love I knew was in your throat
It was then with arms entwined we both broke down and cried
For it seemed ike nothing good would ever come
The doctor bills we couldn't pay they came and took our car away
But there never was a time we didn't love
Now there's an easy chair for my back a satin pillow for your head
And the kids are wild about the brand new car
You and I can order steak with all the trimmings and not worry
If we've spent a dollar more than we can spare
No wonder in your prayers we've thanked the man upstairs who led us through
The years of rearin' kids and payin' bills
And I think he guide us not because we were smart but just because
There never was a time we didn't love
No there never was a time never was a time never was a time we didn't love"
"Well, I heard about it
That kind of need that keeps a person sleepless
All that dreaming just the same
And I read about it
I've just decide if someone leaves you breathless
But I never felt that way now I feel It
I'm not so sure I like it
But I feel it consume it be
And it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony, sweet agony, sweet agony
If you had it planned out to give yourself halfway
And leave me wanting more right here on the brink
Well, your time just ran out I've got to hide it all
What are you waiting for
I'm too afraid to think what this thing is
I'm not so sure I like it that expenses just killing me
And it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony, sweet agony, sweet agony
I want the real thing tired of daydreams
And don't you tease me anymore
You've got the real thing to keep me waiting
I never felt like this before
And it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Oh, it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you"

Well I met a boy from Grassy Branch
Fine as he can be
I met him at the big barn dance
And he took a shine to me
Sky-blue eyes, a big wide smile
And tall as a sycamore tree
He's real smart with a real big heart
And he's gonna marry me
He's gonna marry me
And we're gonna go to town
We're gonna buy some real good car
And we're gonna drive around
We'll hold hands an' touch 'n' hug
He talks so sweet to me
Cause he knows a lot about love and stuff
And he's gonna marry me
His momma don't like me one little bit
But you know I don't care
Let her pitch her hissy-fit
Cause I ain't a'marryin' her
He's always been a momma's boy
It's just plain jealousy
She's as mad as an old wet hen
Cause he's gonna marry me
Oh, an' he's gonna marry me
An' he's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little babe of three
Cause he done kiss me on the mouth
An' he's gonna marry me
Yeah, he's gonna marry me
He's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little babe of three
Cause he's done kiss me on the mouth
So he's gotta marry me
Yeah he's done kiss me on the mouth
And he's gonna marry me

"THE TWELFTH OF NEVER
WITH KEITH URBAN
WRITERS JERRY LIVINGSTON, PAUL FRANCIS WEBSTER
You ask me how much I need you, must I explain? I need you, oh my darling, like roses need rain You ask how long I'll love you, I'll tell you true Until the Twelfth of Never, I'll still be loving you Hold me close, never let me go Hold me close, melt my heart like April snow I'll love you 'til the bluebells forget to bloom I'll love you 'til the clover has lost its perfume I'll love you 'til the poets run out of rhyme Until the Twelfth of Never and that's a long, long time Until the Twelfth of Never and that's a long, long time"
"As I sit here tonite the jukebox's playin
The song about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words they are saying
It brings memories when I was a trusted wife
It was not God who made Honky Tonk Angels
As you said in the words of you're song
Too many times married men think, they're still single
And that's why many a poor girl do go wrong
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame
It was not God who made HTA
As you said in the words of you're song
Too many times married men think, they're still single
And that's why many a poor girl do go wrong"
"I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love with a girl,
That's what's the matter with me
I'm in love,
I'm in love, with a beautiful girl,
But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,
How I sighed and I cried
But she just refused
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,""
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone
I'm yearning for it yet
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy""
Twas just a beautiful dream
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome
and get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,""
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone
I'm yearning for it yet
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy
Twas just a beautiful dream"
"(Dolly Parton)
Backstory:
Tabloid prediction: Dolly Parton will announce she's falling madly in love with a 300 pound professional wrestler. She'll write a song about their relationship titled ""Headlock on My Heart"" and feature her massive muscleman in the video.
Dolly: Now this actually came out in this magazine. Now, you folks I'm sure buy these every week at the supermarket, right? And you know they never put anything in these magazines that's not true, right? So I figured since I was gonna fall in love anyhow, why wait? So I went out and I found me a 300 pound wrestler and I sat down and I wrote a song called ""Headlock on My Heart"" and I did a video. As a matter of fact, in the same magazine on a page opposite, there was a picture of Hulk Hogan. Now, I love Hulk Hogan. My Daddy's crazy about him, so I called Hulk, I said ""Would you do this?"" 'Cause the song is a fantasy, and it's about a guy named Starlight Starbright. He said ""Aw sure, I'd do anything with you, Dolly!"" I said ""Well, thanks, Hulk, I ought to hug your neck!"" So wouldn't that be something if me and Hulk really wound up getting married? Watch this video...
Song:
The first time that I saw him
Was in a wrestling magazine.
Then I watched him on TV,
Then I bought a ringside seat.
His name was Starlight Starbright,
The greatest in the land.
He sprinkled stardust in my eyes
I was his biggest fan.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Referee: 300 pounds of magic right here in the ring tonight.
Starlight Starbright: Wrestling fans, big and small, who's the greatest of them all?
Dolly: Starlight! Starlight Starbright! Starlight! Starlight Starbright!
He dazzled 'em with brilliance,
He outshined all the rest.
And I loved the heart that beat
Beneath his massive golden chest.
Spoken:
Dolly: In this ring, I thee wed.
Referee: Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
Starlight Starbright: I do!
Referee: And do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
Dolly: I do, I truly do!
Referee: I now pronounce you man and wife.
Dolly: Uh, you may now kiss the bride.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Dolly: Well, it's a whole new arena for me,
But it's a whole new wrestling match for him.
I guess you could say he pinned me down for a lifetime.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart."
"Back home, back home
Yes, I'm going back home
Why I can't believe it's been this long
Since I've seen mom and dad
When I left my mountain home behind
I left them both so sad
My brothers and my sisters that were babies then are grown
Years have past and now at last, I'm on my way back home
Back home, back home
Yes I'm going back home
To the factory smoke and city life, I'm sayin' so long
I've shed a lot of tears through all the years that I've been gone
And I've spent a lot of time a' wishin' I could go back home
I got a letter from mama an'
Mama asked me if I'd come back home
She says it sure is lonesome now
Since all of us kids are all growed up and gone
I just can't hardly stand the thoughts of
Momma and daddy being left there all alone
That's really all I need to know
And now I'm on the road back home
Back home, back home
Yes, I'm going back home
To the smog an' smoke an' city life, I'm sayin' so long
I've shed a lot of tears through all the years that I've been gone
And I've spent a lot of time a' wishin' I could go back home"
"You might wake up some mornin'
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow
Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'
Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love"
"Sugar pie honey bunch you know that I love you
I can't help myself I love you and nobody else
Wanna tell in and out my life you come and go
Leaving just your picture behind
and I kissed it a thousand times
When you snap your finger or wink your eye I come a running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings and there's nothing I can do
Sugar pie honey bunch I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you tell you that we're through and I've tried
But every time I see your face I get all choked up inside
When I call your name girl it starts the flame burning in my heart
tearin it all apart no matter how I try my love
I cannot hide 'cause"
"Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me!
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss-man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
An' the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5, whoa what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5, working 9 to 5"
"Peace in the valley for me some day
Well, I'm tired and so weary, but I must travel on
'Til the Lord comes and calls me away, oh, yes
Where the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night is as bright as the day, oh, yes
There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
Only peace in the valley for me, oh, yes
Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh, yes
And the beasts from the wild shall be led by a little child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh, yes"
"(Dolly Parton)
Well I met a boy from Grassy Branch
Fine as he can be
I met him at the big barn dance
And he took a shine to me
Sky-blue eyes, a big wide smile
And tall as a sycamore tree
He's real smart with a real big heart
And he's gonna marry me
He's gonna marry me
And we're gonna go to town
We're gonna buy some real good car
And we're gonna drive around
We'll hold hands an' touch 'n' hug
He talks so sweet to me
Cause he knows a lot about love and stuff
And he's gonna marry me
His momma don't like me one little bit
But you know I don't care
Let her pitch her hissy-fit
Cause I ain't a'marryin' her
He's always been a momma's boy
It's just plain jealousy
She's as mad as an old wet hen
Cause he's gonna marry me
Oh, an' he's gonna marry me
An' he's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little babe of three
Cause he done kiss me on the mouth
An' he's gonna marry me
Yeah, he's gonna marry me
He's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little babe of three
Cause he's done kiss me on the mouth
So he's gotta marry me
Yeah he's done kiss me on the mouth
And he's gonna marry me

"Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
Like T-O-why or maybe S-you-are-P-are-I-S-E
But the words we're hiding from him now
Tear the heart right out of me
Our D-I-V-O-are-see-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-see-E
Watch him smile, he thinks it's Christmas
Or his 5th Birthday and he thinks see-you-S-T-O-D-why spells fun or play
I spell out all the hurtin' words and turn my head when I speak
'Cause I can't spell away this hurt that's drippin' down my cheek
Our D-I-V-O-are-see-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-see-E"
"I've chased after rainbows
I've captured one or two
I've reached for the stars
I've even held a few
I've walked that lonesome valley
Topped the mountain, sowed the sky
I've laughed and I have cried
But I have always tried
I've always been a dreamer
And dreams are special things
But dreams are of no value
If they're not equipped with wings
So secure yourself for climbing
Make ready for the flight
Don't let your chance go by
You'll make it if you try
So try to be the first one up the mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to be the one who makes a difference
Try to put your fear and doubt aside
And try to make the most of every moment
'Cause if you never try you never win
So try each day to try a little harder
And if you fall, get up and try again
(Try and try and try)
(Try and try and try)
Nothing is impossible
If you can just believe
Don't live your life in shackles
When faith can be the key
The winner's one who keeps determination in his eyes
Who's not afraid to fly and not afraid to try
So try to be the first one up the mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to count your blessings and keep counting
And try to soar where only eagles fly
And if you fail at first just keep on trying
For you are not a failure in God's eyes
The first step is the one that's always hardest
But you won't amount too much if you don't try
So spread your wings and let the magic happen
Cause you'll never really know if you don't try
(Try and try and try)
You gotta try (Try and try and try)
Come give it a try (Try and try and try)
You have to try (Try)
Oh I know it ain't easy
Who ever said it was?
Life is hard
Same as it ever was (Try)
You have to try (You have to try)
When you think you can't do it, just try a little harder
Just dig a little deeper and go a little farther but try (Try)
You have to try (Try)
Whatever it is, you're gonna get through it
Let the spirit lead you, I know you can do it, just try (Try)
Just give it a try
And whenever you think you ain't gonna make it
Put a smile on your face, suck it up and fake it
For a while (Give it a try)
At least you'll know you tried (Give it a try)
Don't think I don't suffer, I know what I'm saying
When I get to that place when I start praying and I try
Lord knows I try
Yes I try"
"Ping pong
I use to like
Ping pong
Now I'm in a ding dong, ping pong game of love with you
Ping pong
It scares me now
Ping pong
My heart is the ball in a ding dong, ping pong game with you
I serve it to you
And you knock it back
You hit it so hard, hard, hard
Its startin' to crack
Ping pong
You're smashed again

And I'm losing this ding dong, ping pong game of love with you
I serve it to you

"No we can't control the evil that surround us
But as long as we're together that's enough
If there were just the two of us how different things would be
No one could come between us from now on
The wagging tongues would speak no more the sounds of gossip gone
Without a prying ear to fall upon
No we can't control the evil that surround us
But as long as we're together that's enough
Though we have no power over those around us
We can act as if there's just the two of us
[ steel - fiddle ]
Though clouds of doubt may drift about upon a stormy sea
I'll only draw you nearer onto me
As long as we're together we'll never walk alone
We'll build a world of sunshine of our own
No we can't control the evil that surround us..."
"As I travel life's pathway to that city beyond
I find the way so narrow and my strenght almost gone
Then I cry oh Lord have mercy please don't leave me all alone
Cause somehow I've got to make it make heaven my home
I'll keep climbing I'll keep climbing till I make it my home
And I'll soon be with Jesus round the great white throne
Though the way may seem rugged Lord I must travel on
I'll keep climbing I'll keep climbing till I make heaven my home
My friends they forsake me my companions are few
I'll keep my eyes toward heaven no matter what others do
I'll keep my mind upon Jesus for his way I will choose
Soon I'll reach heaven's portal seems it's almost in view
I'll keep climbing...
I'll keep climbing...
Make heaven my home"
"FIGHT AND SCRATCH
Duet by Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner
Copyright 1970
Fight and scratch fight and scratch that's all we ever do
There surely must be more to love than to fight and scratch with you
You you to fight and scratch with you
Well you just bought a foal last month now you want a wig
It looks like you couldn't understand my paycheck ain't that big
Well what about the dough you lose in them poker games downtown
I figured you'd mention that smart aleck
Yeah and that brand new boat and that fishin' gear
But no uhhuh I don't reckon that'd count really
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Sometimes I swear I think that you're the devil in disguise
Cause when you're mad you oughta see the fire fly from your eyes
Well you don't look so cute yourself when you're mad at me
And if you don't like the way I look then you know how to leave Bossy Catfish
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Well I love you and you love me but we're always findin' fault
But the way we fight you wouldn't know that we had any love at all
We just fight like cats and dogs we'll leave then come right back
For what excitement would we have if we didn't fight and scratch
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Why don't you drop dead oh you'd like me to and I'll live forever just for spite
Why don't you keep your big mouth shot
Well why don't you just make me if you think you're big enough
Yeah and I could whip you with both hands tied behind
Yeah you just try it with me and I'll knock your brains out
With a stick of soap that's good Catfish
What's a catfish why'd you call me that
They're all mouth and no brains boy that's really good
It's all I can do to keep from laughin' hah
That's funny you sure are a fynny little fellow"
"I couldn't wait forever
Did you expect me to
I guess you thought I'd never
Find somebody new
I lived on dreams and promises
As long as I could
I couldn't wait forever
The way you thought I would
The lonely nights grew longer
As I prayed for time to fly
I lived on hopes that you'd return
And that's how I got by
The agony of loneliness
Just got too much for me
I couldn't wait forever
Needing love so desperately
So I found new lips to kiss me
New arms to hold me tight
I found new love and happiness
To fill these empty nights
You took my love for granted
Now my heart has found a new home
I couldn't wait forever
Forever's just too long
I couldn't wait forever
Forever's just too long"
"What will I do when you are gone?
Who's gonna tell me the truth?
Who's gonna finish the stories I start,
The way you always do?
When somebody knocks at the door,
Someone new walks in
I will smile and shake their hands,
But you can't make old friends
You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
It was me and you, since way back when
But you can't make old friends
How will I sing when you are gone?
'Cause it won't sound the same
Who'll join in on those harmony parts,
When I call your name?
You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
It was you and me, since way back when
You can't make old friends
When Saint Peter opens the gate,
And you come walking in
I'll be there just waiting for you
'Cause you can't make old friends
'Cause you can't make old friends, no no
When I'm out on the stage all alone
And I hear the music begin
We all know the show must go on
But you can't make old friends, no no
You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
And you and me, will be young again
You can't make old friends
You and me, will be together again
'Cause we both know, we will still be old friends
You can't make old friends
Not the way we have always been"

Yes I see God where the mountains reach the sky
And I see God when the eagle starts to fly
I see God in a little baby's smile I see God and he makes my life worthwhile
Yes I see God when the bridegroom meets his bride
I see God in a father's loving eyes
I see God when a mother starts to cry I see God in a love that never dies
(I see God) where the people meet to pray (I see God) in the things they do and
say
(I see God) when the little children play
I see God and I know he's near all way
I see God yes I see God"

At last I have called up with you and you're a sight to see
Could this really be my outlaw lover JJ Sneed
Could a woman with a painted face and pretty sweet disguise
Turn your heart against me with her evil cunning eyes her evil cunning eyes
JJ it's been you and me right from the very start
And ever job we ever pulled I'd always done my part
We'd really stick together until the bitter end
And it was my understanding we were whole lots more than friends
A whole lot more than friends
And it was me that kept you on when nights were dark and cold
But I guess I didn't look like much in these old ragged clothes
But you said it didn't matter cause you love me that a way
You said that no one else could ever steal your heart away steal your heart away
Do you recall the Union Bank we robbed in Franklin Town
And as we made our getaway the sheriff gunned you down
And I doctored up your bullet wounds and nursed you while you sit
But now you have betrayed me is that the thanks I get is that the thanks I get
Oh yeah JJ I'm thinking now of how we'd all begun
Of all the times we've robbed and killed with our trust wordy gun
Why we stood off a fuss it was JJ just you and I
But now you have betrayed me and for that you're gonna die
Yeah for that you're gonna die
The good old days are over as we stand here in the rain
JJ I'm gonna shoot you now I hope you'll feel no pain
I hear whoopees of the horses and fieces on my trail
I guess I'll join you soon but for now JJ farewell for now JJ farewell"
"You never cease to amaze me
You can still make me crazy
Baby you can turn me on with just your eyes
You're just so darn appealing
Ooh, you stir up sexy feelings
Every man in the room would love to try you on for size
Baby ,wait 'til I get you home
Wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home, sweet baby
Wait 'til I get you home
Oh baby you still make me
Feel feelin's that can take me
To places where I've never been before
Well honey I've got a feelin'
We'll make some shadows on the ceilin'
Tonight by candlelight behind closed doors
Baby, wait 'til I get you home
Wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home, sweet baby
Wait 'til I get you home
Your lovin' gets better each time we're together
It's always exciting and new
Each time we discover, we're still like young lovers
It's always been magic with you
Baby wait 'til I get you home
You just wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home sweet darlin'
Wait 'til I get you home

They say the love we steal is a disgrace
That we should be ashamed to look the world in the face
But they don't know how much love we must hide
While the world looks down upon our pride
Seems there's always someone looking down down down
Not knowing inner feelings of the ones they're puttin' down
(The love we feel's as true as a baby's crying sound)
Still there's always someone looking down
We still honor the vows we made long ago
But when there's no love at home it hurts us so
And then your heart begins to look around
Love found us now the world's a looking down
Seems there's always someone...
The love we must keep silent hurts us now but love will always find a way
somehow
Till then the world will look at us and frown
But we'll love each other while they're looking down
Seems there's always someone...
Seems there's always someone looking down"

How blind can he be

Well where were you last night when I came home
When I came in you were out and gone
Well I waited up till up to two then I went downtown to look for you
So how's about tellin' me where you were at
Well me and the boys stopped off for a drink or two
(Now ain't you a pretty thing)
Well we got to drinkin' and I guess that time just flew
Well the time must've flown for you alright
Cause I thought you're gonna stay out all night
And I told myself I ain't a puttin' up to that
There's always two sides to every story...
You said you went downtown to look for me
Did you have to dress up fancy as could be
You know I never leave the house you know jacky clothes lookin' like slut
And I's downtown just to look in my best for you
Now I'm not accusin' you of doin' wrong
But that's awful late for you to be out and gone
Now look who's talkin' bout bein' late and I wasn't about to sit and wait
Why you were at that when with no tellin' who"
"(Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner)
Oh, the pain of loving you
Oh, the misery I go through
Never knowing what to do
Oh, the pain of loving you
You just can't stand to see me happy
Seems you hurt me all you can
Still I go on loving you
But I never understand
To love and hate at the same time
The line between the two is fine
The two have bound me heart and soul
So strong that I can't let you go"
"Some day you're gonna want me but I ain't gonna be around
Some day you'll find you miss the kiss that you're forever turnin' down
When you decide you want the love that once you could've had
Well that's gonna be to bad and you're gonna be sorry
You're gonna be sorry for all the dirty deals you've handed me
All the nights you stayed away you wished you'd spent with me
While you were busy makin' out, I was busy makin' plans for checkin' out
And when you find this out, you're gonna be sorry
You'll wake up cryin for me like I've done so many nights for you
You'll walk the floor and you'll call my name but I ain't gonna hear you
You'll curse the night and you'll hate yourself for ever doin' me wrong
But I'm gonna be long gone and you're gonna be sorry
You're gonna be sorry for all the dirty deals you've handed me
All the nights you've stayed away you wished you'd spent with me
While you were busy makin' out, I was busy makin' plans for checkin' out
And when you find I'm gone, you're gonna be sorry"
"In the presence of you I wonder
Why I can't say the things that I want to
All the pretty words that I planned to say when I'm with you
I lose them in the presence of you
Your nearness makes my voice tremble
There's a weakness that I feel through and through
Searching for words to describe how I love you
Don't come easy in the presence of you
Love and admiration might make my words silent
But feelings say more than words do
And the feeling of loving you is all around me
Anytime I'm in the presence of you
Love and admiration might make my words silent..."
"(Dolly Parton)
Say forever you'll be mine
Forever is the love that is filled with understanding
Forever is the love that is true and undemanding
Forever is the love that can stand the test of time
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Trouble clouds may fill our skies
It might even rain awhile
But the rain will go away
There's always a brighter day
Darling, I won't promise you
That we'll be happy all the time
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Say forever you'll be mine, forever I am yours
And I'll do anything that you ever ask me to
And I'll do what you want me to"
"(Joe South)
Oh the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
Never saying what they mean
Oh they whine away the hours
In their ivory towers
Til they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Oh they make one another cry
Break their hearts and they say good-bye
Cross their heart and they hope to die
That the other was to blame
Neither one will ever give in
So they gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' 'bout the way it might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Oh they teach how to meditate
Read your horoscope and teach you faith
The furthermore the hell with hate
Come on and get on board
Look around and tell me what you see
What's a-happenin' to you and to me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play"
"In a shingle covered cottage at the foothills of blue stacks
Near a mountain stream that's flowing crystal clear
Where the humming birds and honey bees feed on Mama's roses
My mem'ries just grow sweeter with the years
Mem'ries of my childhood are as sweet as mountain honey
And as fresh as a dew on morning glory vines
I grew up surrounded by the sights and sounds of nature
And they're forever present in my mind
But I'm headed in the wrong direction home
Headed in the wrong direction home
There's no place like home
But I'm headed in the wrong direction home
Teardrops mingled with the summer rain that was a falling
The day I left my mountain home behind
With a suitcase in my hand and a hope in my heart
I was following a dream I had to find
In that shingled covered cottage at the foothills of the smokies
Waits a family hat I'm longing to see
And mountain streams and fields of green
And rolling hills stay in my dreams
But I'm many, many miles from Tennessee"
"How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
And how many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
So always make me wonder
And always make me guess
Even if I ask you
Darlin', don't confess
No you just let that remain your secret
'Cause darlin' I do love you so
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know"
"All your love lifting me higher
Than I ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
Then I'll be at your side forevermore
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
Now once I was downhearted
This little loneliness my foes and friend
But when you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
I'm so glad I finally found you
Yes that one in a million girl
And now with my loving arms around you
I can stand up and face the world
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher"
"Thoughtfulness tenderness makes love grow stronger
Thoughtfulness brings happiness makes love last much longer
Love is like a tender young flower
It needs care from the time you sow
Tender words of love are like summer showers
Makes love strong when cold winds blow
Thoughtfulness tenderness...
Pull out the weeds of doubt and jealousy give love a chance to grow
Kisses are like sunshine you'll soon see love can bloom even in the snow"
"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying the stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying the stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
Oh, it makes me wonder
Oh, it makes me wonder
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
Oh, it makes me wonder
Oh, it makes me wonder
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying the stairway to heaven"
"Saw you turnin' down main street
In your big, black fancy car
You were dressed up fit to kill
With a pretty girl on your arm
You spun around and you headed up town
Where the neon lights all shine
Left me choking in a cloud of dust
You never pay me no mind
Chorus:
You're livin' in the fast lane
I guess I'm just too slow
I never wore silk or fancy furs
Just plain ole calico
I'll never be a fast lane lover
And they're the only kind you take up town
I am just a country road
That you keep turnin' down
If you ever hit a dead end street
If it's love that you're looking for
You can always turn around
And beat a path right to my door
Do I have to draw you a map
You seem to know your way around
So when you're tired of spinnin' your wheels
Baby, we can go to town
Repeat Chorus
I'll never be a fast lane lover
And they're the only kind you take up town
I am just a country road
That you keep turnin' down
I am just a country road
That you keep turnin' down
Repeat Chorus"
"The gates and doors were barred
And all the windows fastened down
I spent the night in sleeplessness
And rose at every sound
Half in hope of sorrow
And half in fear the day
Would find the soldiers breakin' through
To drag us all away
And just before the sunrise
I heard something at the wall
The gate began to rattle
And a voice began to call
I hurried to the window
Looked down into the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldiers' feet
But there was no one there but Mary
So I went down to let her in
John stood there beside me
As she told me where she'd been
She said they've moved Him in the night
And none of us know where
The stone's been rolled away
And now His body isn't there
We both ran towards the garden
Then John ran on ahead
We found the stone and empty tomb
Just the way that Mary said
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in
Was just an empty shell
And how or where they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell
Oh something strange had happened there
Just what I did not know
John believed a miracle
But I just turned to go
Circumstance and speculation
Couldn't lift me very high
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him
Then I saw Him die
Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything I'd promised Him
Just added to my shame
When at last it came to choices
I denied I knew His name
And even if He was alive
It wouldn't be the same
But suddenly the air was filled
With a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from everywhere
Drove shadows from the room
And Jesus stood before me
With His arms held open wide
And I fell down on my knees
And I just clung to Him and cried
Then He raised me to my feet
And as I looked into His eyes
The love was shining out from Him
Like sunlight from the skies
Guilt in my confusion
Disappeared in sweet release
And every fear I ever had
Just melted into peace
He's alive yes He's alive
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive yes He's alive
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive
Hallelujah He's alive
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive He's alive
I believe it He's alive
Sweet Jesus"
"You packed in the morning
I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I miss you more
Than I missed you before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
Yes, you left me
Just when I needed you most
Now most every morning
I stare out the window
I think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me
'Cause I need you more
Than I needed before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
Yes, you left me
Just when I needed you most
You packed in the morning
I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I love you more
Than I loved you before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
You left me
Just when I needed you most
Oh, you left me
Just when I needed you most"
"Robert's appearance is something to behold
Dressed in the finest of store bought clothes
My mamma sews my clothes cause I'm just a poor girl
But Robert is as real as his daddies gold
Robert could have any girl that he wanted
But his feelings for me each day seems to grow
He don't know the reason, that he's so drawn to me
But there is a story that Robert doesn't know
Oh Robert
Oh Robert
Robert is constantly making eyes at me
He misunderstands the feelings we share
There's no way that I can return his glances
But I know the meaning of the feeling that's there
Robert if you knew, there once was a rich boy
In love with a poor girl, long time ago
But the folks of that rich boy, would not let them marry
And I am a symbol of the love that they stole
Oh Robert
Oh Robert
Robert, oh Robert if you only knew
The same blood is flowing in both me and you
That rich boy's your father, but he's also mine
And my mamma's the poor girl that he left behind
Oh Robert
Oh Robert"
"I lie in bed beside you and watch you while you sleep
And wonder who I was before I loved you
Lying here beside you feeling so complete
Thinking how I love and need and trust you
Because I love you I'm a brand new person now because you love me
I can face the world and have the cause I love you
Because you love me because I love you
[ strings ]
Sweeter even still is knowing that you're lying there
And let you soon awake and reach to hold me
And anyway you want me that's the way that I am yours
Love as strong as this lets you control me
Because I love you...
Because I love you..."
"Hear the evening breezes start to blowing
See the evening shadows start to come
Listen to the nightbirds start their singing
Now the sounds of night have just begun
A lonely hootowl cries out in the darkness
For its mate that's nowhere to be found
Then a lonesome whippoorwill strats calling
Their lonely voices fill the night with sound
Hear the church bell ringing in the distance
What a mournful sound so late at night
Wonder why the darkness makes it sound so lonesome
Listen to the lonely sounds of night
[ steel ]
The darkness seems to whisper in the silence
Your love is gone but things will be all right
Still my lonely heart cries through the darkness
Listening to the lonely sounds of night
Hear the church bell ringing in the distance..."
"In the presence of you I wonder
Why I can't say the things that I want to
All the pretty words that I planned to say when I'm with you
I lose them in the presence of you
Your nearness makes my voice tremble
There's a weakness that I feel through and through
Searching for words to describe how I love you
Don't come easy in the presence of you
Love and admiration might make my words silent
But feelings say more than words do
And the feeling of loving you is all around me
Anytime I'm in the presence of you
Love and admiration might make my words silent..."
"(Dolly Parton)
I'm a drifter, a driftin' drifter
Got no place to call my home no more
I'm a wanderer, a wandering wanderer
Got no one to call my own no more
Got no strings to tie me down
Got no cause to hang around
What difference does it make which way I go
Got an empty feelin' down inside
Still I need to stay alive
And who can tell what waits beyond this road
I'm a drifter, a driftin' drifter
Got no one to call my own no more
Got no strings to tie me down
Got no cause to hang around
What difference does it make which way I go
Got an empty feelin' deep inside
Still I need to stay alive
Who can tell what waits beyond this road
I'm a drifter, a driftin' drifter
Got no one to call my own no more"
"This is how I learned it from a Time-Life Album in about 1958.
There's a little rosewood casket
Lying on a marble stand
And a packet of old love letters
Written by my true love's hand
[Go and bring them to me sister
Read them o'er for me tonight
I have often tried but I could not
For the tears that filled my eyes] I did not know this verse--Thanks!
Last Sunday I saw him walkin'
With a lady by his side,
And I thought I heard him tell her
He would never be his bride.
When I'm dead and in my coffin
And my shroud's around me bound
And my narrow grave is ready
In some lonely churchyard ground.
Take his letters and his locket
Place together o'are my heart
But the golden ring he gave me
From my finger never part"
"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do
[Chorus]
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.
La la la la,
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days
Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say
[Chorus]
Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me
[Chorus]
Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same
[Chorus]"
"I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While traveling through this world of woe
Yet there's no sickness, toil or danger
In that bright world yo which I go
I'm going there to see my father
I'm going there no more to ram
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home
I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me
Where God's redeemed their vigils keep
I'm going there to my mother
She said she'd meet me when I come
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over me"
"Last night, my tears they were fallin'
I went to bed so sad and blue
Then I had a dream of you
I dreamed I was strollin' in the evenin'
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinkin' about you
And then you met me in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there too
I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her, you looked at me
I wondered who you were talkin' to
I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking more inside
'Cause I was still wonderin' who
Your arm was restin' on her shoulder
You smiled at her, she smiled at you
Her eyes were filled with victory
She said my brother wants to marry
And then my heart was filled with ease
I knew that you would marry me
Oh, I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her, you looked at me
I knew that you would marry me
I don't believe you've met my baby"
"The neon lights of a movie marquee
Says the show today is Love Is Free
And inside a boy and a girl on a date
Their folks are gone away they're gonna stay out late
A little later on in a lover's lane
They park in the dark with their hearts in flames
He says oh baby go along with me
I need you so and love is free
In a simple little room in a Chatanooga home
For girls that need a friend and are all alone
She waits for a letter that never comes
From a boy that won't admit what he's done
She had to leave school cause she couldn't stand the shame
Her daddy said she ruined the family name
Her mama cries herself to sleep at night
That's no way to start a young girl's life
Love isn't free no it ain't free
No matter what they say somebody has to pay for love
In an orphanage home a sad little girl
Six years old and all alone in the world
She knows by now what they never say
That she once had a mom but she gave her away
People come to visit but don't choose Marie
She cries at the door nobody loves me
And somewhere a boy doesn't care at all
That her tear at night stains her little rag doll"
"I used to think maybe you loved me now baby I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait 'til you write me you're coming around
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
And don't it feel good
Hey, alright now
And don't it feel good, hey
I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true
And I don't want to spend my whole life, just waiting for you
Now I don't want you back for the weekend
Not back for a day, no no no
I said baby I just want you back
And I want you to stay (Oh yeah now!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
And don't it feel good
Hey, alright now
And don't it feel good (Yeah!)
And don't it feel good
Walking on sunshine
Walking on sunshine
I feel the love, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real
I feel the love, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real
I'm on sunshine baby (Ow! Oh yeah!)
I'm on sunshine baby (Ow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
I'm walking on sunshine (Wow!)
And don't it feel good (Hey! Alright now!)
And don't it feel good (I'll say it I'll say it I'll say it again now)
And don't it feel good (Hey yeah now!)
And don't it feel good (Don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it)
Feel good

And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
And don't it feel good
Now don't it feel good"
"Life's like poetry and in my poem bay
Until now there's always been a missing line
You know life's too short to hide a good thing you feel
And I find the morning after
Is the best time to determine if it's real
Baby, finding you gave my whole world reason to rhyme
'Cause life's like poetry and in my poem bay
Until now there's always been a missing line
Life's too short to think about right or wrong
And the only thing I wonder 'bout
Is where you been so long
'Cause baby finding you gave my whole world reason and rhyme
And life's like poetry and in my poem bay
Until now there's always been a missing line
Until now, there's always been a missing line"
"As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto
People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto
As her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto"
"(Dolly Parton)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, what will do I with you gone?
Sitting in my lonely room just staring at the wall
For lack of something else to do I count the tears that fall
Trying to get it through my head you don't care at all
What am I gonna do with you gone?
What does life hold for me anymore?
With you gone what once mattered don't matter no more
You still have the key to my heart and my door
What am I gonna do with you gone, with you gone?
I can hear the lonesome whistle of a passing train
I can feel my heart beat a rhythm with the pouring rain
Realizing that my life won't ever be the same
What am I gonna do with you gone?
Will I ever be happy again?
With you gone my whole world has just come to an end
Will I ever forget you, or will I forget
What am I gonna do with you gone, with you gone?
With you gone, What does life hold for me anymore?
With you gone what once mattered don't matter no more
And you still have the key to my heart and my door
What am I gonna do with you gone, with you gone?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, what will do I with you gone?"
"Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, little darling
Until the day they lay me down
In dreams of you, my body trembles
I wake up and call your name
But you're not there, and I'm so lonesome
Without your love I'd go insane
Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, little darling
Until the day they lay me down
I close my eyes and you're there with me
Your kiss I feel, your face I see
It's not your lips now that drive me crazy
It's just your haunting memory"
"Well, I think it's fine buildin' jumbo planes
Or takin' a ride on a cosmic train
Switch on a summer from a slot machine
Yes, you can get what you want, if you want it
'Cause you can get anything
I know we've come a long way
We're changin' day to day
But tell me where do the children play?
Well, you roll on roads over fresh green grass
With your heavy loads pumping petrol gas
And you make 'em long and you make 'em tough
And you just go on and on and it seems you can't get off
I know we've come a long way
We're changin' day to day
But tell me where do the children play?
Crack the sky, scrapers fill the air
But you keep on buildin' higher
'Til there's no more room up there?
Will you make us laugh?
Will you make us cry?
Will you tell us when to live?
Will you tell us when to die?
I know we've come a long way
We're changin' day to day
But tell me where do the children play?
Tell me where do the children play?
Well, I think it's fine buildin' jumbo planes
Or takin' a ride on a cosmic train
But, where do the children play?
Just tell me where do the children play?"
"Letra de Lover Du Jour -
""Lover Du Jour""
What are you looking at, lover boy?
It won't do you any good
Cause I know your kind
If you wanna be mine
We gotta get this understood
Oh, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
Your special off the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in the hell for you, for sure
If you think I will be, I'll be your lover du jour
I'm what? (Lover du jour) Not me!
I am well aware of your good looks and se*y ways
Serving up yourself to girls to satisfy your taste
The fresh catch of the day on your Romeo buffet
Served up hot and ready just having it your way
Well, if I'm on the menu, you'd better get this straight (Lover du jour)
Me and you had better come to terms before you grab your plate
Don't need one place to order if you believe that I
I'm just some cheesy little dish, just another chickie pie
Oh, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
The flavor of the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in the hell that I'll endure
The fact that I would only be your lover du jour
Oubliez-moi! Forget me!
Still looking, lover boy?
Have you changed your view?
I told you once, I'll say it again
I'll take no merit from you!
That's crap!
If you want something appetizing
Something real and satisfying
I'll be worth a second look, but that's the only way!
Cause, I'm not gonna be your, be your l'amour du jour
Your playmate of the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Cause I won't be caught up in all your charm and your allure
No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
The special off the day, no way, I'll do farewell, bonjour
Pardon my French, but there's no chance in the hell that I'll endure
The fact that I would only be your lover du jour
No, I'm not gonna be your, be your lover du jour
Your lover du jour
No, I am not for your amusement
I am not a toy, you are nothing but trouble
You are a bad bad boy! (l'amour du jour)
I am a tasty starter around a full course meal
Desert half after dinner drink, and you can have no feel...
Pardon my French ...
Any questions?
Ugh, my French is awful but my love is awesome
They gonna laugh at me in France, sorry..."
"I've chased after rainbows
I've captured one or two
I've reached for the stars
I've even held a few
I've walked that lonesome valley
Topped the mountain, sowed the sky
I've laughed and I have cried
But I have always tried
I've always been a dreamer
And dreams are special things
But dreams are of no value
If they're not equipped with wings
So secure yourself for climbing
Make ready for the flight
Don't let your chance go by
You'll make it if you try
So try to be the first one up the mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to be the one who makes a difference
Try to put your fear and doubt aside
And try to make the most of every moment
'Cause if you never try you never win
So try each day to try a little harder
And if you fall, get up and try again
(Try and try and try)
(Try and try and try)
Nothing is impossible
If you can just believe
Don't live your life in shackles
When faith can be the key
The winner's one who keeps determination in his eyes
Who's not afraid to fly and not afraid to try
So try to be the first one up the mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to count your blessings and keep counting
And try to soar where only eagles fly
And if you fail at first just keep on trying
For you are not a failure in God's eyes
The first step is the one that's always hardest
But you won't amount too much if you don't try
So spread your wings and let the magic happen
Cause you'll never really know if you don't try
(Try and try and try)
You gotta try (Try and try and try)
Come give it a try (Try and try and try)
You have to try (Try)
Oh I know it ain't easy
Who ever said it was?
Life is hard
Same as it ever was (Try)
You have to try (You have to try)
When you think you can't do it, just try a little harder
Just dig a little deeper and go a little farther but try (Try)
You have to try (Try)
Whatever it is, you're gonna get through it
Let the spirit lead you, I know you can do it, just try (Try)
Just give it a try
And whenever you think you ain't gonna make it
Put a smile on your face, suck it up and fake it
For a while (Give it a try)
At least you'll know you tried (Give it a try)
Don't think I don't suffer, I know what I'm saying
When I get to that place when I start praying and I try
Lord knows I try
Yes I try"
"Gimme some straight talk, straight talk
And hold the sugar please
Straight talk, straight talk
Sounds plenty sweet to me
Don't talk to me in circles
In some mumbo-jumbo jive
Gimme just straight talk, straight talk
And we're gonna be alright
'Cause I like to know just where I stand
I don't like guessing games
And I hate a bunch of gibberish
So just spit it out real plain
Don't use big educated words
From your BS Degree
Straight talk, straight talk
Don't try bossing me
Straight talk, straight talk
Turn loose and let it go
You can tell me anything
Just like on Oprah's show
Just tell me how you really feel
Be on the up and up
With questions I can understand
For answers you can trust
Pick up the 'phone, you're not alone
We've all got something to say
So listen in and listen up
We'll find a better way
With honesty and common sense
It's really hard to miss
Straight talk, straight talk
Just tellin' it like it is
Straight talk, straight talk
There's nothing like the truth
Just tell me all your troubles
Pretend I'm Donahue
So don't be shy, 'cause we can talk
You know you've got a friend
Call me, call me
For simple straight talkin'
What's cookin', America?
Straight talk, Straight talk
Straight talk, Straight talk
So come on let's talk turkey
Just straight and to the point
About passions, about problems
About noses out of joint
Now I want you all to know
I care and I do understand
And hey, thanks for lending me an ear
Out there in radio land
Give me some straight talk, straight talk
Don't sugar coat it please
Straight talk, straight talk
Sounds sweet enough to me
But don't talk to me in circles
In your mumbo-jumbo jive
Straight talk, straight talk
And we're gonna be alright
Straight talk, straight talk
Makes plenty sense to me
Don't talk to me in circles
In your mumbo-jumbo jive
Gimme just straight talk, straight talk
And we're gonna be alright
Gimme just straight talk, straight talk
And we're gonna be alright"
"Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.

Darling, Well, Don'tcha know that I can tell whenever I look at you,
That you think that I'm untrue,
'Cause I said that I love two,
But I really, really do.
'Cause you're a split personality.
And in reality, both of them are you.

"Got my eye on a boy
He's eyeing me back
It's looking real good
This could be it
And I know that all of you girls
Would love to steal him away
He bought me a drink
I thanked him real sweet
It's always so nice when you first meet
And I know that all of you women would love to steal him away
So I'm warning you
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Building up an appetite
You can look but you can't buy
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Pretty as a picture
Comin' on so strong
He's twisting my ignition key
Turn my motor on
But anyone can see, all his attention's on me
Give us some privacy
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Better keep your hands off my
It's a welcome turn to try
Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend
Leave us alone tonight
Then if it don't work out right
He's all your's
Until then
Better keep your hands off my
Better keep your hands off my

They keep crowdin' in on me
He smiles rather unsuspiciously

Better keep your hands off my potential new boyfriend"
"Love is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
I feel it when you're with me
It happens when you kiss me
That rare and gentle feeling that I feel inside
Your touch is soft and gentle
Your kiss is warm and tender
Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies
Love is like a butterfly
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
Your laughter brings me sunshine
Everyday is spring time
And I am only happy when you are by my side
How precious is this love we share
How very precious, sweet and rare
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies
Love is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing"

The mid summer sun shines but dim the fields try in vain to look gay
But when I was happy with him December was pleasant as May
There once was a time he and I picked flowers to braid in my hair
And the songbirds would sing sweet song of love that was tender and fair
No difference the seasons may quit our love was as warm as the sun
And it mattered not where did the snow
Or green grass kissed the fields where we'd run
Now the mid summer sun shines...
Sweet flowers sweet birds and sweet song have now lost their sweetness to me
For ever my darling is gone and for ever my heartbroken I'll be
Now the mid summer sun shines...
The mid summer sun shines but dim mmm"
"Back through the years I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
""Perhaps this coat will brang you good luck and happiness""
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colors that my momma made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my momma made for me
So with patches on my britches, holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
and my coat of many colors my momma made for me
And oh I couldn't understand that for I thought I was rich
And then I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed
And why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes
They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
One is only poor only if you choose to be
It is true we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors momma made for me
Made just for me"
"(Bob Tubert & Demetrius Tapp)
Folks back home think I'm a star now when they hear my records play
They say there home town girl made good and she'd go a long long way
Mom wonders why I don't drive back in that big fine car I own
The truth is I don't have a car and I'm ashamed to go back home
A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick
A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit
These are all my possessions all I have to my name
And a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame
I'm so glad that dad can't see me now, his favorite little girl
Singing in this dingy place on the wrong side of the world
And I'm glad that I can't see the boy that offered me his name
For I was blind and turned from him in this empty search for fame
A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick
A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit
These are all of my possessions, all I have to my name
And a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame"
"(Dolly Parton)
Last night you called me Barbara
As you lay fast asleep
And although I'm not Barbara
You wanted me to be
You whispered words I haven't heard
In such a long, long time
Last night you said I love you
With Barbara on your mind
Sometimes I find traces of her kisses on your skin
And strands of chestnut hair
That say you've been with her again
Little traces of her that it breaks my heart to find
Last night you called me darlin'
With Barbara on your mind
With Barbara on your mind
You held me in your arms so tight
And lying there so close to you
I cried until day light"
"(Dolly Parton)
I'm a drifter, a driftin' drifter
Got no place to call my home no more
I'm a wanderer, a wandering wanderer
Got no one to call my own no more
Got no strings to tie me down
Got no cause to hang around
What difference does it make which way I go
Got an empty feelin' down inside
Still I need to stay alive
And who can tell what waits beyond this road
I'm a drifter, a driftin' drifter
Got no one to call my own no more
Got no strings to tie me down
Got no cause to hang around
What difference does it make which way I go
Got an empty feelin' deep inside
Still I need to stay alive
Who can tell what waits beyond this road
I'm a drifter, a driftin' drifter
Got no one to call my own no more"

Chorus:
Love is pretty when love is new
Like a blushing rose in a dazzling dew,
Intoxicating like cherry sweet wine.
When love is new it's magic.
Verse 1:
Mother, oh Mother, why can't you see
He's the only love for me.
Why must thou be opposed to me
I'm asking for thy blessing.
Daughter, oh daughter, I know his kind.
You think he's handsome, you think he's fine.
He'll use your body and tangle your mind;
Too late you'll learn this lesson
Repeat Chorus
When love grows cold, it's tragic
Verse 2:
Mother, oh mother, he's not that way
His touch just takes my breath away.
You surely remember when you felt that way
When you and father first married
Oh, yes, I do remember it well.
What first was heaven soon turned to hell
He left with another the year you were born.
I told you he's dead and buried.
Repeat Chorus
Bridge:
He'll love me true 'cause he told me so.
He'll break you heart when love grows old.
I must go, Mother, I must go.
Then, daughter, why are you asking?
I love him so, I love him so.
Then I pray you're new love's lasting.
Repeat Chorus
Tag:
When love grows cold, it's tragic."
"Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
And I dreamed about the cotton fields and home
I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sister and brother
And I dreamed about the girl who's been waiting for long.
I want to go home, I want to go home
Oh, how I want to go home.
Home folks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars, by night I ake the bars
If only they could read between the lines.
I want to go home, I want to go home
Oh, how I want to go home.
Cause you know I rode a freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find I've just been wasting my time
So I think I'll take my foolish pride
And put it on the south-bound freight and ride
And go on back to the loved ones
The ones that I left waiting so far behind.
I want to go hoe, I want to go home
Oh, how I want to go home."
"Another sleepless night alone, crazy from this jealousy.
I heard you call her on the phone,
Watched you shave and dress and leave.
Walk the floor and watch the clock,
Knowing that you ain't missing me.
Imagination runnin' hot, and you're right where you wanna be.
Do you think I'm made of stone?
Do you think it doesn't hurt when you leave me here alone,
Leaving me to think the worst?
And when you're out there in her arms 'til the wee hours of the dawn,
Do you think it's all a joke?
Can't you see my heart is broke?
Do you think I'm made of stone?
I'm just barely gettin' 'round,
Don't know how I'm getting by.
All our friends I meet in town,
They just can't look me in the eye.
They all know you're runnin' 'round.
Like me, they don't know what to do.
God, I hate their sympathy,
But I just can't turn loose of you.
But do you think I'm made of stone?
Don't you know my pain is real?
It's the worst I've ever known just stayin' at an even keel.
Oh, what am I supposed to do while you cheat and carry on?
I should leave, I know I should;
I just only wish I could.
Do you think I'm made of stone?
Oh, it cuts me like a knife,
You have stripped me of my pride.
What am I supposed to do while you cheat and carry on?
Do you think it's all a joke?
Can't you see my heart is broke?
Do you think I'm made of stone?"
"(Dolly Parton)
There's a place in my mind that's suspended in time
When we were happy in love
Days warm and sweet, and the night so complete
Then life was perfect for us
It was just you and I, only love in our eyes
Not a sign of a tear on our face
No sorrow, no pain, only sunshine, no rain
Before something else took its place
Oh, I wanna go back there
Back to the time there was no doubt you cared
Back to the time love was tender and fair
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Do you think if we tried we could put life aside
And see if we might make it back
I know in my heart what we had at the start
I believe it could still be like that
Oh, I wanna go back there
Away from these heartaches, these worried and cares
Back to the time love was tender and fair
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there (say you care)
I wanna go back, I wanna go back
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there"
"Let's drink a toast to what might've been
To all that we were but can't be again
And let's just be thankful we parted as friends
Here's to the past, let the future begin
Oh, and here's to your wildest dreams
And here's to your everything
May your life be blessed with sweet happiness
Baby, here's to your wildest dreams
I made a promise that I wouldn't cry
You go and chase your rainbows, go on reach for the sky
But come hold me close now, look deep in my eyes
Tell me you love me then kiss me goodbye
Oh, and here's to your wildest dreams, baby
And here's to your everything
May your life be blessed with sweet happiness
Baby, here's to your wildest dreams
I?ll always love you and I'm on your side
In whatever you do, I will take pride
And here's to your wildest dreams, baby
And here's to your everything
May your life be blessed with sweet happiness
Baby, here's to your wildest dreams
Baby, here's to your wildest dreams
Dream on, baby"
"(Dolly Parton)
I was lookin' for greener pastures
When I left my old Kentucky home
I was chasin' after dreams I thought I'd master
So I left the one that loved me all along
Thinkin' only of myself and doin' better
Didn't care about the grief I left behind
Didn't even make a card or write a letter
So sure I'd be successful in no time
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures
And back to the one who's heart I broke
To the bluegrass state of Kentucky
Where he waits with open for me I hope
Ain't it funny how you are when you're younger?
How what you have is never good enough
How the years will find you searchin' through your plunder
Lookin' for the treasures you gave up
Well the seasons came, they went
The dreams all shattered
While the grass just stayed a lonely shade of brown
Then I realized I'd lost all that had mattered
So with foolish pride aside, I'm homeward bound
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures
And back to the one who's heart I broke
To the bluegrass state of ole Kentucky
Where he waits with open for me I hope
Now I'm heading for bluer pastures
Where the bluegrass waves sweetly in the wind
Where the bluegrass music's always playin'
To the haunting sound of Monroe's mandolin
I'm heading for bluer pastures"
"Train, train
Gonna take him on out of this town
Train, train
Gonna take him on out of this town
Yeah, that man I'm in love with
Lord, he's Memphis bound
He's leavin' here
Like a raggedy old coat
Oh, he's leavin' me
That no good so-and-so
Yeah, that man I'm in love with
Lord, he wants to go
Let him go
Good-bye, good-bye
I'll find myself another man
Good-bye, good-bye
I'll find myself another man
You take that night train to Memphis
Me, I'll make new plans
Take that night train to Memphis
Oh leave while you can"

(I'll remember you forever I'll remember you as mine)
Let's pretend tonight that it's the same as always
Let's go back just the little ways in time
Let's fill this one last night with lasting mem'ries
Let's me remember you as mine
Hold me close pretending it's still me and you love
And let me be the only thought that's on your mind
Let's pretend that you don't really have a new love
Oh no let me remember you as mine
I remember you as sunshine that gave lights to my world
I remember you as gentle as this night
I remember you as heaven that let me hold a little while
I remember you whether I remember you as mine
When you leave my arms then I will be alone love
Hold me close love me gently one last time
I won't ever picture you with no one else love no I remember you as mine
I remember you as sunshine...
As mine as mine"
"I remember the time when the bloom was on the cotton
When our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings
Winter cares which we're already few or soon forgotten
Just sittin' on the front porch swing
Oh we sit every Sunday and watched the married ladies
And we dreamed of white dresses and church bells in the spring
And they talked and painted their nails while they let us hold their babies
Sittin' on the front porch swing
Where was I when the time came to join the married ladies
Why did I paint the nail when the finger had no ring
Why do I sit at night at my age to hold their baby
Sittin' on the front porch swing
When the mind longs to follow but the memory erases
And the lips form the words that the heart no longer sings
When the leaves in the hollow have been died to match our faces
Sittin' on the front porch swing"
"Everybody wants to find a love
Somebody, somebody who will always care
We get locked up in our own worlds
With feelings and secrets we're afraid to share
But all I have to do is see you smile
And maybe, just maybe if I brush your hand
Something happens, I cannot explain
And somehow, oh, somehow I can understand
I, I think you're gonna find
Gonna find you, gonna find you
I'm reading your mind
I know you by heart
And you're so much a part of me
I know you by heart, yes, I do
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by heart
I know every time you're gonna call
I pick up the phone before it ever rings
And when you need some lovin'
I'll be there beside you, anticipating everything
Oh, it's like I always said
You're the one I want
All I want is you
I'm inside your head
I know you by heart
Girl, you're so much a part of me
I know you by heart, yes, I do
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by heart
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by heart
I know you by heart
And you're so much a part of me
I know you by heart, I know you, I know you, I know you
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by"

Mine is a jealous heart
Imagines things that never are
Builds a fire from a tiny spark
But that's the way of a jealous heart
Sunny skies and a rosy bed
Thorns and storm clouds up ahead
'Cause suddenly the sky turns dark
For those of us with a jealous heart
Imagination runnin' wild
Like a frantic frightened child
Any time that we're apart
I can't control my jealous heart
And you know mine is a jealous heart
And every hurt leaves a lasting scar
Don't you hate yourself for the fool you are
When you're cursed with a jealous heart
I love you more than words can tell
One day's heaven two days hell
Suspicious words like poison darts
Spoken from my jealous heart
Mine is a jealous heart
Imagines things that never are
Builds a fire from a tiny spark
But that's the way of a jealous heart
And you know mine, you know mine is a jealous heart
And every hurt, and every hurt leaves a lasting scar
Don't you hate yourself for the fool you are
When you're cursed with a jealous heart
And you know mine, you know mine is a jealous heart
Imagines things, imagines things that never are
Builds a fire from a tiny spark
But that's the way of a jealous heart"
"(Dolly Parton)
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
May his name forever stand
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
Was a mighty, mighty man
And he enriched the lives
Of everyone that ever knew him
And in my song I hope to sing
Some of the praise that's due him
Dr. Thomas was a man
The Lord must have appointed
To live among us mountain folks
In eastern Tennessee
And he delivered more than half
The babies in those mountains
Among those babies
He delivered me
There was no way to drive along
The roads back in those mountains
But Dr. Thomas got there
Just the same
He often rode on horseback
To get where he was needed
But if he had to walk
He always came
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
May his name forever stand
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
Was a mighty, mighty man
And he enriched the lives
Of everyone that ever knew him
And in my song I hope to sing
Some of the praise that's due him
Dr. Thomas was a friend
A neighbor and a doctor
Though he seldom got a dime
For all he'd done
And I remember lots of times
We sent for Dr. Thomas
But I don't recall a time
He didn't come
They say a man is judged
By the deeds he does while livin'
A judgement when he stands
Before the Lord
And I know heaven holds a place
For men like Dr. Thomas
And I know that he'll receive
His just reward
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
May his name forever stand
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
Was a mighty, mighty man
And he enriched the lives
Of everyone that ever knew him
And in my song I hope to sing
Some of the praise that's due him"
"So often in my dreams
I hold you close against my skin
Waking up I wish that I could
Sleep and dream again
Cause only when I sleep
Can I not hear how it's a sin
How cheaters never win
Their heartaches never end
""Torn Between Two Lovers"" on the jukebox
And I'm thinking how I could've wrote that song
Wonderin' if God loves us, when we're cheatin'
But why he lets us feels things if it's wrong
I guess I should be singing ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"", some of those good songs
Can't find it in my heart to ask forgiveness
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
Thou shalt not commit it
It's written in the tin
The spirit is always willing
But the flesh is weak again
And you're as close to heaven
As I might ever fly
An angel in disguise
A wrong that feels so right
And Torn Between Two Lovers just keeps playing
And I don't wanna be right if lovin' you is wrong
It goes against all I've ever stood for
Knowin' I have someone else at home
I guess I should be singing ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"", some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart can tell on me tomorrow
Cause anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
To hell with heaven if it means I'll lose you
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
It just can't be"
"I can live in a mansion or a double-wide
Eat sushi raw or my catfish fried
Wherever I am, then that's where I belong
'Cause I'm quite content with who I am
And if you ain't, well, kiss my ham
Country is as country does and I'm country to the bone
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I always will be, that's for sure
Country born and country bred
Countrified and country-fed
A country heart and a country head
'Cause I'm country to the core
Now, I can drive a tractor or a Cadillac
I can fly first class or slum in the back
But I'll be the same ol' gal when I arrive
Oh I can wear denim or I can wear silk
Drink champagne or chocolate milk
Take the best or live with less, 'cause a country girl survives
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
And the way I'll be until they lay me low
Country born and country bred
I'm countrified and I'm country-fed
And I'll be that way 'til I'm country dead
'Cause I'm country head to toe
And what you see is what you get
Nothing's ever changed me yet
Nothing will, it's a pretty safe bet
'Cause I'm country through and through
Oh, that's country!
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I'll be until my dying day
I'm country born and country bred
Countrified and country-fed
And nothing done and nothing said can change my country ways
Nothing done and nothing said
Nothing's gonna change my country ways
I don't think so
Wouldn't change if I could
Country is as country does
It's the way I is and it's the way I was
Country born and country bred
I'm countrified and I'm country-fed, you know that
I'm country (she's country)
But now that don't mean I can't go to town!"
"If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my children and my wife
I'd thank my lucky stars
To be living here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.
From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston
And New York to L.A.
Well there's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A."
"(Dolly Parton)
You come to me with teardrops in your eyes
Expecting me to listen to your lies
You want me to forget and to forgive
Enough, enough, this ain't no way to live
I know you wonder why I'd leave like this
After all the hurt I've put up with
This is the last time, this is the last straw
Too late, too late now it's your time to crawl
She's just the straw that broke the camel's heart
It's not her fault, it's yours we fell apart
No more, I'm done, I want a brand new start
She's just the straw that broke the camel's heart
I've been grasping at straws for much too long
This ain't the first time you have done me wrong
This time you drew the short end of the straw
The game is over, you have lost it all
She's just the straw that broke the camel's heart
It's not her fault, it's yours we fell apart
No more, I'm done, I want a brand new start
It's just the straw that broke the camel's heart
She's just the straw that broke the camel's heart"
"When you're rocking back and forth there by the window
And the sun shines through the silver in your hair
I'll think of all the years we've spent together
And of all the good and bad times we have shared
We've seen happiness that could match heaven's beauty
And each sadness like the flaming pits of hell
But each thing we share just makes our love grow stronger
And I love you more than words could ever tell
When the golden years have slowly come upon us
And our children have all married off and gone
You know sweetheart each day our love grows more exciting
And I love you more as each day passes on
We've seen happiness that could match heaven's beauty
And we love each other more than words can tell
And each day as we grow closer to God's calling
I pray he'll call us at the same time there to dwell"
"(Dolly Parton)
Say forever you'll be mine
Forever is the love that is filled with understanding
Forever is the love that is true and undemanding
Forever is the love that can stand the test of time
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Trouble clouds may fill our skies
It might even rain awhile
But the rain will go away
There's always a brighter day
Darling, I won't promise you
That we'll be happy all the time
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Say forever you'll be mine, forever I am yours
And I'll do anything that you ever ask me to
And I'll do what you want me to"
"It's my time
Gather round girls
You I grew up with
My old friends that I used to scuff with
Need you round me
At this time
You've all had your turn to cry
An old friend stood closely by
Friends of mine
Stand by me
'Cause it's my time
It's my time
It's my time
It's my time to cry
Mm mm mmm
It's my time to cry
Oh oh oh oh
It's my turn to cry yeah
It's my time
Gather round boys
I used to play house with
Come here boys
I first kissed on the mouth with
Need your tender words so kind
You've all had your misty eyes
An old friend stood by to dry
Friends of mine
Stand by me
'Cause it's my time
It's my time
It's my time
It's my time to cry
Whoa whoa
It's my time to cry yeah
It's my turn to cry mmm
It's my time
It's my time
It's my time to cry mmmm"
"(Joe South)
Oh the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
Never saying what they mean
Oh they whine away the hours
In their ivory towers
Til they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Oh they make one another cry
Break their hearts and they say good-bye
Cross their heart and they hope to die
That the other was to blame
Neither one will ever give in
So they gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' 'bout the way it might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play
Oh they teach how to meditate
Read your horoscope and teach you faith
The furthermore the hell with hate
Come on and get on board
Look around and tell me what you see
What's a-happenin' to you and to me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am
La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play"
"Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, little darling
Until the day they lay me down
In dreams of you, my body trembles
I wake up and call your name
But you're not there, and I'm so lonesome
Without your love I'd go insane
Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, little darling
Until the day they lay me down
I close my eyes and you're there with me
Your kiss I feel, your face I see
It's not your lips now that drive me crazy
It's just your haunting memory"
"I'm watching the clock, it says five to five
The minutes are ticking so slow
I'm ready to stop, gonna close up the shop
So honey if you're ready lets go
Take out your pinstripe suit
And your fancy cowboy boots
Now ain't it a crime when you're lookin' so fine
And tonight you're mine, all mine
Chorus:
Packin' it up, movin' on out
Headed up to the big town
Sure like them big city lights on a Saturday night
Coming in from the country
Second Chorus:
Packin it up, movin' on out
Headed up to the big town
Sure like those big city lights on a Saturday night
Coming in from the country
Take off my blue jeans
Slip on the hottest dress that you've ever seen
Just like an ad in a fashion magazine
It's you and me babe, a sight for sore eyes to see
Take in a movie or maybe a show
Dance all night just letting it go
Champagne and roses waiting back at our suite
So kick off your boots and make sweet love to me
Repeat Second Chorus 3X
Repeat Second Chorus To Fade"
"Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as goneI stand here in the doorway of the room where you lie sleeping
In hopes that I don't wake you up with the sounds of my weeping
It breaks my heart to see you laying there
Alone in the bed we used to share
'Cause you no longer want me and I wonder what went wrong
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone
There's so much more between us than just these lonely walls
The echoes of our dying love lingers in the halls
Living separately together in a house that's not a home
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone
Through the eyes of a broken heart, I watch my whole world fall apart
I'm trying to revive a love that's died
Hopelessly I'm holding on to a love I know is gone
Gone, but not because I haven't tried
Disappearing from your door way now the hurt is twice as strong"
"(Parks)
Mama, I remember what you told me
You said you wait for love before you fall
But, mama, I am sorry, I guess it's gonna be love after all
'Cause mama, when he holds me
The air is thick and sweet
He asked me if I'd come tonight
And hold him in his sleep
And I'm almost in love
I can feel myself fallin'
Yes, I'm almost in love
I can hear my heart fallin'
'Cause I'm almost in
Yes, I'm almost in love
Mama, I've grown into a woman
I been growing stronger and stronger day by day
Mama, you know about children
You raise them then they'll go away
Mama, when he holds me
He thrills me through and through
So dry your eyes and teach me how to say goodbye to you
And I'm almost in love
I can feel myself fallin'
Yes, I'm almost in love
I can hear my heart fallin'
'Cause I'm almost in
Yes, I'm almost in love
Yes I'm almost in love
I can feel myself fallin'
Yes I'm almost in love
I can hear my heart fallin'
Yes I'm almost in love
I can feel myself fallin'
Yes I'm almost in love
I can hear my heart fallin'
'Cause I'm almost
Yes, I'm almost in love"
"You think you're so smart you think that you'd throw my heart
Don't at your feet every time that you walk by
But I, I got news for you cause I don't care for you and
I don't care honey if you love me or not
If you were half as smart as you think you are
The world would be a-standing at your door
But I, I won't be there cause I no longer care and
I don't want you around me anymore
Because you can't have your way you tell me every day
I should grow up stop acting like a child
But I, I think its you that's got some growing to do
And honey I think its gonna take you quite a while
If you were half as smart as you think you are
The world would be a-standing at your door
But I, I won't be there cause I no longer care and
I don't want you around me anymore"
"(Dolly Parton)
Beauty is a rare perfume
Precious, yet doesn't last long
Youth is but a playful breeze
That blows our way once then moves on
Love is a hidden treasure
Some never find where it lies
And memory is a little bird
Flies through life, live or dies
Little bird
Take me aboard your beautiful wings and let me fly
Fly me away back to yesterday
And drop me off there awhile
Let me smell the rare perfume of the sweet flower of beauty again
Let me run in the playful breeze of youth long gone with the wind
Let me sit for awhile by the place where I found the treasure of love
Then sing me a song as you fly me along on our long last journey above"
"I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You think you know the smile on her lips
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You think you'll find heaven of bliss
In each caress, in each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You stole her love from me one day
You didn't care, oh, it hurt me
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be.
You think she's yours, to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn, when her love grows cold
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her."
"I'm gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss you
You fought a good fight, may you rest in peace now
You've earned the right, you stood brave and tall
The ultimate price, we honor you now
For God and country, you gave it all
And although I'm proud of all that you stood for
My selfish heart just wants you home
Your family and friends are all so proud of you
But I can't accept the fact that you're gone
And I'm gonna miss you
When the golden sun sinks slowly o'er the crest of yonder hill
I'm gonna miss you
In the wee hours of the mornin' when the world is calm and still
When I can see you, touch you, feel you, hear your heart beating true
Even though you're gone, my love lives on
And I, I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
Your touch, your smell, your kisses, and the comfort of your eyes
I'm gonna miss you
Your laughter, tears, your humor, and that crooked little smile
And I'm gonna miss the plans and dreams we had that never will come true
God wanted you, but I did too
And I, I'm gonna miss you
I'll miss you"
"Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
Saying something about a queen
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run in the 20th century
Look at Mother Nature on the run in the 20th century
I was lying in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eye
I was hoping for replacement
When the sun burst through the sky
There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like I could cry
I was thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There was children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home"
"WE'LL GET AHEAD SOMEDAY
Duet by Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner
Writer Mack Magaha
Copyright 1967
We'll get ahead somedays we'll get ahead someday
If the sun comes up and my wife cuts down we'll get ahead someday
Well I get up early work hard all day listen to the troubles of my friends
But I don't realize till I get home whan an awful shape we're in
The car's wore out kids need shoes got a bill from a doctor today
The landlord said you'll get out tomorrow if you don't get me some pay
We'll get ahead someday...
The paper says there's a sale downtown I gotta have some money today
Well there's things at home that's never been used you bought last bargain day
Well you go out one Saturday night just spend too much money on wine
Well I work hard all week long and I gotta have a little fun sometimes
We'll get ahead someday...
If the sun comes up and my wife cuts down we'll get ahead someday"
"Ah, now I don't hardly know her
But I think I could love her
Crimson and clover
Ah when she comes walking over
Now I've been waitin' to show her
Crimson and clover over and over
Yeah, my, my such a sweet thing
I wanna do everything
What a beautiful feeling
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over"
"Nobody believes that I really care for you
They don't think my heart is true
I don't think you agree
You know I'm a lifetime gaurantee
So if they ask you what you mean to me
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Go on and tell 'em baby
Nobody believes we got somethin' they ain't got
They've never seen a fire this hot
They never got that far
We're burning as bright as any star
So if they ask you what your feelings are
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We've got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Go ahead and tell 'em baby
Feels so good, holding tight
Loving you through the night
Oh and they can call it what they like
But they ain't got it right
No, no, no
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We've got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything
Oooo...
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Oh, oh, oh
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough"
"(Dolly Parton)
The greatest gift, the gift of life
The gift of love divine
God gave us all a special gift
He meant for it to shine
He meant for it to shine
The darkest night can be made light
By one bright word or smile
If we'd put on our neighbor's shoes
And choose to walk a mile
God gave us all our own free will
To choose the paths we take
No greater deed could e'er be done
Than for another's sake
The greatest gift, the gift of life
The gift of love divine
God gave us all a special gift
He meant for it to shine
He meant for it to shine
Shine on, shine on, for all to see
God's light inside your soul
Shine on, shine on, let love flow free
Warm others in its glow
Shine on, shine on, shine on
So hide it not or it will fade
Shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on, shine on
The greatest gift, the gift of life
The gift of love divine
God gave us all a special gift
He meant for it to shine
Shine on, shine on, shine on"
"If you go, I'll follow you
You can't leave my love behind
If you go (if you go) I'll follow you
Even death could never end this love of mine
I have loved you for so long
With a love both true and strong
You are all I'll every have
And I'll love you good or bad
Where you go I'll go with you
No matter where you take me to
I'll go through hell And back again
I'll be with you Until the end
If you go, I'll follow you
You can't leave my love behind
If you go (if you go) I'll follow you
Even death could never end this love of mine
If you go, I'll follow you...."
"At my door the leaves are fallin'
A cold wild wind will come
Sweet hearts walked by together
And I still miss someone
I go out to a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Cause I still miss someone
Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there"

"Two people, together
It was just a dream until you came along
My heart was waiting just for you
Tomorrow, forever
We both heard these promises for far too long
And now you make the words come true
So touch me now
I need to have you close tonight
And show me how
You can me feel this way
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key
Can't keep it, a secret
Everything I feel is written on my face
I can't hide my heart from you
You hold me, is magic
In your arms the world becomes a better place
Now I know what love can do
Here we go
Exactly where the road will lead us
I don't know
I just know that you'll be there
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key
And whenever you, I'm there
Every stumble and fall, I share
I'll be yours through it all
Coz I care, about you baby
It's so easy to see, so strong
Now I know you and me, belong
I'll be by your side forever....
# you and me, we are the right combination
For love, we're all we need
It's just you and me, we make the right combination
Straight from the heart, love is the key"
"(Dolly Parton/Bill Owens)
You lied to me
I can't believe
That I've been such a fool
I thought this time
I might find
Someone who would play by the rules
My mind said no
But my heart said go
And again I've made the wrong turn
Now here I stand
My heart in your hands...
And I've gone from burning to burned
Ah, you'd think by now
I'd know how
To keep this heart of mine safe
It goes to show
You just never know
Who can you trust these days
How could I make
The same mistake
But as far as I'm concerned
Got myself to blame
Got to close to the flame
Now I've gone from burning to burned
Everyone knows
The old saying goes
That a fool in love
Never learns
But I guess I forgot
'Cause the fire was too hot...
Now I've gone from burning to burned
Oh I guess I forgot
'Cause the fire was too hot...
Now I've gone from burning to burned"
"We three kings of Orient are bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain moor and mountain following yonder star
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain gold I bring to crown him again
King forever ceasing never over us all to reign
Star of wonder star of night star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding guide us to Thy perfect light
Frankincense and moor have I my gift of love and sacrifice
Pray'r and praising all men raising worship in God most high
Oh star of wonder star of night..."
"How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
And how many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
So always make me wonder
And always make me guess
Even if I ask you
Darlin', don't confess
No you just let that remain your secret
'Cause darlin' I do love you so
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know"
"That's the way love is you have to love and learn
I've lost again but can't I win these tears that I cried make my eyes burn
Each new love I'd find turns out to deepen the wrong time
And it looks like I'll just have to love and learn
Love and learn just hurt and yearn for someone who will love me in return
I'll be hurt many times before the right one I find
But that's the way love is you have to love and learn
[ steel ]
Love and learn...
Yes that's the way love is you have to love and learn"
"(Dolly Parton)
I didn't cry all of these tears just to have you show up here again
I didn't lie awake all these nights to have you come walking back in
I didn't change my whole life around, not to mention my dreams and my plans
To have you come back with your same ol' act thinking that I'll understand
Time and tears have mended the pain
Healed all the hurt and changed everything
Time and tears I'm happy to say
Time and tears have washed it away
Time and tears have washed you away
I didn't think that I would survive the day that you walked out on me
I truly was more dead than alive; and the pain, Lord I couldn't believe
I asked God to please have mercy on me and to ease all the feelings I felt
Then I saw the light, now I'm more than alright;
I'm much better off since you left
Time and tears have mended the pain
Healed all the hurt and changed everything
Time and tears have carried me through
Time and tears got me over you
Time and tears and somebody new
Time and tears is all that it takes
To mend shattered hopes or a heart when it breaks
Time and tears have carried me through
Time and tears got me over you
Time and tears and somebody new
Time and tears, time and tears got me over you
Time and tears, got me over you"
"(Porter Wagoner)
Darling you know, you know I love you like I love no other
And you told me, remember when you told me, you'd forget her in time
Time passes by but still you can't forget her, it looks like you can't forget her
Oh and that makes me wonder if you'll ever, ever be mine
There's no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart
While there's another, another still on your mind
There's no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart
Not when there's another, another still on your mind
There's just no way, no way I'm gonna get inside of your heart, inside your heart
Not while there's another, another still on your mind, still on your mind"
"In grave in my mind there are pictures mem'ries of a love I knew one time
So I find in my thoughts I stand looking
At the mem'ries hanging on the walls of my mind
I see a mem'ry of raindrops falling in the park on the day we met
Walking with each other through the rain laughing talking as we both got soak and wet
The mem'ry made that day I could never put away
That's the day he told me he'd be mine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
And I have a mem'ry of springtime cherry blossoms and bird singing on the vine
And the secret place we'd hide and laid together side by side
And the love that shined so brightly in his eyes
Springtime I recall was the sweetest time of all
That's the season our hearts became entwine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
Through the spring and summer he loved me and his love died with autumn leaves
His love was the wild and restless kind
When he left he left with me so many memories
He left them hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
Mhm mhm hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
He left them hanging on my mind"
"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you"
"If every time that you got hurt it left a scar
And if every dream you ever had broke your heart
If every time you made a plan the world came to an end
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
If broken dreams are all it seems you've ever known
And hurt's the only thing you can depend upon
And if you should find misery to be your only friend
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
If every time you look up a cloud should hide the sun
Pay dearly for each kindness ever shown to anyone
If everything you try should fail before you can begin
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again"
"Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him two lips like roses and clover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Sandman, I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic brean
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him the word that I'm not a rover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace
Mister Sandman, someone to hold
Would be so peachy before we're too old
Sp please turn on your magic beam
Mister Sandman, bring us
Please, please, please
Mister Sandman, bring us a dream"
"I've chased after rainbows
I've captured one or two
I've reached for the stars
I've even held a few
I've walked that lonesome valley
Topped the mountain, sowed the sky
I've laughed and I have cried
But I have always tried
I've always been a dreamer
And dreams are special things
But dreams are of no value
If they're not equipped with wings
So secure yourself for climbing
Make ready for the flight
Don't let your chance go by
You'll make it if you try
So try to be the first one up the mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to be the one who makes a difference
Try to put your fear and doubt aside
And try to make the most of every moment
'Cause if you never try you never win
So try each day to try a little harder
And if you fall, get up and try again
(Try and try and try)
(Try and try and try)
Nothing is impossible
If you can just believe
Don't live your life in shackles
When faith can be the key
The winner's one who keeps determination in his eyes
Who's not afraid to fly and not afraid to try
So try to be the first one up the mountain
And try to be the first to touch the sky
And try to count your blessings and keep counting
And try to soar where only eagles fly
And if you fail at first just keep on trying
For you are not a failure in God's eyes
The first step is the one that's always hardest
But you won't amount too much if you don't try
So spread your wings and let the magic happen
Cause you'll never really know if you don't try
(Try and try and try)
You gotta try (Try and try and try)
Come give it a try (Try and try and try)
You have to try (Try)
Oh I know it ain't easy
Who ever said it was?
Life is hard
Same as it ever was (Try)
You have to try (You have to try)
When you think you can't do it, just try a little harder
Just dig a little deeper and go a little farther but try (Try)
You have to try (Try)
Whatever it is, you're gonna get through it
Let the spirit lead you, I know you can do it, just try (Try)
Just give it a try
And whenever you think you ain't gonna make it
Put a smile on your face, suck it up and fake it
For a while (Give it a try)
At least you'll know you tried (Give it a try)
Don't think I don't suffer, I know what I'm saying
When I get to that place when I start praying and I try
Lord knows I try
Yes I try"
"(Porter Wagoner)
You're gentle body lying here so close to me
As you move your hand slowly across my face
You're touch is as soft as the words you speak to me
What a love in the way I see you
I compare it with the beauty of the dawning
Or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue
Like a butterfly that has a million colors, all such beauty
Like the love in the way I see you
I compare it with the beauty of the dawning
Or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue
Like a butterfly that has a million colors, all such beauty
What a love in the way I see you"
"As I travel life's pathway to that city beyond
I find the way so narrow and my strenght almost gone
Then I cry oh Lord have mercy please don't leave me all alone
Cause somehow I've got to make it make heaven my home
I'll keep climbing I'll keep climbing till I make it my home
And I'll soon be with Jesus round the great white throne
Though the way may seem rugged Lord I must travel on
I'll keep climbing I'll keep climbing till I make heaven my home
My friends they forsake me my companions are few
I'll keep my eyes toward heaven no matter what others do
I'll keep my mind upon Jesus for his way I will choose
Soon I'll reach heaven's portal seems it's almost in view
I'll keep climbing...
I'll keep climbing...
Make heaven my home"
"Gimme some straight talk, straight talk
And hold the sugar please
Straight talk, straight talk
Sounds plenty sweet to me
Don't talk to me in circles
In some mumbo-jumbo jive
Gimme just straight talk, straight talk
And we're gonna be alright
'Cause I like to know just where I stand
I don't like guessing games
And I hate a bunch of gibberish
So just spit it out real plain
Don't use big educated words
From your BS Degree
Straight talk, straight talk
Don't try bossing me
Straight talk, straight talk
Turn loose and let it go
You can tell me anything
Just like on Oprah's show
Just tell me how you really feel
Be on the up and up
With questions I can understand
For answers you can trust
Pick up the 'phone, you're not alone
We've all got something to say
So listen in and listen up
We'll find a better way
With honesty and common sense
It's really hard to miss
Straight talk, straight talk
Just tellin' it like it is
Straight talk, straight talk
There's nothing like the truth
Just tell me all your troubles
Pretend I'm Donahue
So don't be shy, 'cause we can talk
You know you've got a friend
Call me, call me
For simple straight talkin'
What's cookin', America?
Straight talk, Straight talk
Straight talk, Straight talk
So come on let's talk turkey
Just straight and to the point
About passions, about problems
About noses out of joint
Now I want you all to know
I care and I do understand
And hey, thanks for lending me an ear
Out there in radio land
Give me some straight talk, straight talk
Don't sugar coat it please
Straight talk, straight talk
Sounds sweet enough to me
But don't talk to me in circles
In your mumbo-jumbo jive
Straight talk, straight talk
And we're gonna be alright
Straight talk, straight talk
Makes plenty sense to me
Don't talk to me in circles
In your mumbo-jumbo jive
Gimme just straight talk, straight talk
And we're gonna be alright
Gimme just straight talk, straight talk
And we're gonna be alright"
"(Bill Owens)
Like the morning sun
His love moved across every inch of my body
And the heat from the fire burned me up with desire
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven for sure
This morning when I opened my eyes
There to my surprise
Lay that angel I thought had been only a dream
And so I said a little prayer
And thanked God, that he was there
Oh, this is a dream come true
Dream do come true
I know 'cause I found you
I never thought they did
But now I do
Dreams do come true
It was love at first sight
And it was love all night
And the way he made love to me
Fulfilled all my fantasies
Ooo, this is a dream come true
Yes, dreams do come true
I know 'cause I found you
I never thought they did
But you're living proof
That dreams do come true
Dreams do come true
And I am so in love with you"
"I can see you're disappointed
By the way you look at me
And I'm sorry that I'm not
The woman you thought I'd be
Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman
So when you look at me
Don't feel sorry for yourself
Just think of all the shame
You might have brought somebody else
Just let me tell you this
Then we'll both know where we stand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman
Now a man will take a good girl
And he'll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
Well, that's a different situation
He'll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band
Now I know that I'm no angel
If that's what you thought you'd found
I was just the victim of
A man that let me down
Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman
No, my mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman"
"To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven
A time to be born, a time to die
A time to plant, a time to reap
A time to kill, a time to heal
A time to laugh, a time to weep
To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven
A time to build up, a time to break down
A time to dance, a time to mourn
A time to cast away stones
A time to gather stones together
To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven
A time of love, a time of hate
A time of war, a time of peace
A time you may embrace
A time to refrain from embracings
A time to gain, a time to lose
A time to rend, a time to sew
A time to love, a time to hate
A time of peace, I swear it's not too late"
"Fresh scrubbed hot off the bus
Dressed up and feeling good
Eyes full of stars a heart full of dreams
Daisy Mae in Hollywood
Struttin' down the boulevard
The walkway of the stars
With a vision of her name in lights
Reflecting off the cars
And dreaming of a white limozeen
She wants to have a white limozeen
Well, the days to come were long and dark
And the nights were hard and cold
She met the devil in the City of Angels
But she never lost her soul
She kept her dreams close to her heart
Like a family photograph
She cried sometimes and died sometimes
But still she knows how to laugh
Dreaming of a white limozeen
Dreaming of a white limozeen
Now she's a living her dreams like a movie queen
Diamond rings and all things good
From the breadlines to the headlines
She's the toast of Hollywood
White limozeen
White limozeen
Now she's really ridin' high
She's a woman of the world
But deep inside she never changed
She's the same old down home girl
And when the airplane brings the kinfolk
To visit for awhile
There's a friendly guy in a red bow tie
To take 'em around in style
He drives 'em in a white limozeen
She finally got a white limozeen
Now she's a living her dreams like a movie queen
Diamond rings and all things good
From the breadlines to the headlines
She's the toast of Hollywood
She was fresh scrubbed hot off the bus
Dressed up and feelin' good
Eyes full of stars a heart full of dreams
Daisy Mae in Hollywood
She goes struttin' down the boulevard
The walkway of the stars
With a vision of her name in lights
Reflectin' off the cars
And dreamin' of a white limozeen
She finally got a white limozeen
Oh, ridin' in a white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen
A big white limozeen
Limozeen, a white limozeen

"I'm sorry I was weak enough to step out on you
Well I should have been strong enough not to step out on you too
I know that I'd hurt you and I stepped out for spite
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right
I'm not making excuses for myself I was wrong as I could be
But you shouldn't have cheapened yourself trying to get even with me
My conscience bothers me mine won't let me sleep at night
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right
Two wrongs don't make one right and now we both got heartaches
But if we both try we can forgive each other for our mistakes
We let no wonderful love slip through our hands we's better hold on tight
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right"
"I hoped I wouldn't miss you long
But I still can't believe you're gone
And I still miss you just as much as always
I hoped I'd get you off my mind
It's been a long time but I find
That I still think of you as much as always
As much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always
As much as always just as much as always
I still miss you, still think of you
Just as much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always
I still want you, still need you
Just as much as always
I hoped that I'd find someone else
But there's too much of you still left
And I still love you , just as much as always
I hoped that I'd forget your touch
But I still want it just as much
And I still need it just as much as always
As much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always
As much as always, just as much as always
I still miss you, still think of you
Just as much as always
As much as always, just as much as always
I still love you, oh I do love you

As much as always, as much as always
I still love you, still want you, just as much as always

I still need you still love you

I'll never ever let you go, oh my

I know that that will be the day
That I die, oh my

We might be at it until dawn, oh my

You see where I've been and you know where I'm going

My heart's on my sleeve and my love is showing
And if you stay around
I'm never ever gonna let you down, oh my, oh my

"Where you live you say the view is so beautiful
And the astroturf that's on your lawn stays green the whole year around
And the buildings are so tall they almost reach heaven
But do you ever ever hear the robins sing
Do you hear the robins singing in the springtime
While a mockingbird sings his happy song
Is all the beauty in your world this artificial thing
Do you ever ever hear the robins sing
[ ac.guitar ]
Where I live the butterflies still kiss the roses
And forgetmenots still grow along the shady lane
And the weeping willow trees still swaying in the breeze
And often I still hear the robins sing
Do you hear the robins...
Do you ever ever hear the robins sing"
"(Dolly Parton)
We're all together once again
For the first time in I don't know when
We were so close once upon a time
There were five of us kids at home
Two girls, three boys and Dad and Mom
But that was in the better part
Of life we left behind
Remember that old swimming hole
Where we would swim so long ago
And all them possum grapes and muskedines
And do you recall the time
We all got drunk on homemade wine
That was in the better part
Of life we left behind
Life was simple for us then
If only it could be again
How I wish we could go back in time
But time moves on and nothin' lasts
Except the memories from the past
Memories from the better part
Of life we left behind
Remember how we talked as kids
Of what we'd be when we got big
And all the dreams that we held in our minds
I wanted to be a singin' star
And you all said that I'd go far
But that was in the better part
Of life we left behind
Remember all the fun we had
Back when they say times were bad
And life was good to us and things were fine
We had fun and we had love
And a mom and dad to care for us
But that was is the better part
Of life we left behind
Life was simple for us then
If only it could be again
How I wish we could go back in time
But time moves on and nothin' lasts
Except the memories from the past
Memories from the better part
Of life we left behind
Sweet memories from the better part
Of life we left behind"
"Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your roof's too close at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You are the reason I'm traveling home
Don't think twice, it's alright
There ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
That night, I never know'd
Ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me want to change my mind and stay
We never did do much talking anyway
Don't think twice, it's alright, no
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright
But there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
Like you never did before
And there ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
'Cause I can't hear you anymore
Well, I'm thinking and wonderin' all the way down the road
I once loved a man but that love grew old
I gave him my heart, but he wanted my soul
Don't think twice, it's alright
Walking down that lone lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound well I can't tell
But goodbye is too good a way, babe
So I'm gonna say thee farewell
But I ain't saying you treated me unkind
You could have loved me better, but no, I don't mind
But you just kinda sorta wasted my precious time
Don't think twice, it's alright, no
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright
Don't think twice, don't think twice it's alright"
"(Dolly Parton)
I wish you all the luck I wish you only the best
Satisfaction in love, and true happiness
I wish you blue skies and rainbows, I wish you joy pure and sweet
I wish you all that you wish for, but only if you're with me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I wish you nothin' but trouble if you've decided to leave
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I have had you too long, I have given too much
I have loved you too strong to think of giving you up
I've always envied those lovers that wish you well when you leave
And wish you luck with another; but there are others like me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
And every face you look into, I hope you're haunted by me
Yes, I'm possessive and jealous; at least I speak honestly
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy, never ever ever happy
Never ever ever happy
With anybody but me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I wish you nothin' but trouble if you've decided to leave
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy"
"(Dolly Parton)
Somewhere a river of happiness flows
We'll sit on its banks while the warm breezes blow
Somewhere there's a garden where only love grows
Somewhere a river of happiness flows
Dry your eyes, don't cry no more
We'll find a place where there's laughter and joy
So take my hand and don't let go
Come with me and together we'll go
Somewhere a river of happiness flows
We'll sit on its banks while the warm breezes blow
Somewhere there's a garden where only love grows
Somewhere a river of happiness flows
We'll walk in the sunshine
We'll laugh and we'll sing
And dance to the tune that our happiness brings
Come go with me to this place I speak of
Together, we'll find it, this place is called love
Somewhere a river of happiness flows
We'll sit on its banks while the warm breezes blow
Somewhere there's a garden where only love grows
Somewhere a river of happiness flows
Somewhere a river of happiness flows"
"(Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner)
Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't live with you gone
Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't make it alone
You bring me the sunshine when none is in sight
And when I'm in darkness, you bring me the light
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see
So please, oh, please don't stop loving me
You're my inspiration, my purpose in life
When things go all wrong, you make them all right
I would be useless if you ever leave
So please, oh please don't stop loving me
Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't live with you gone
Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't make it alone
Please, please don't stop loving me"
"I saw him picking up the pieces of his broken heart
And so I stopped to see what I could do
His heart had been run over by a reckless lover
She ran over it and broke it and left it black and blue
Tears were scattered everywhere he was trying to save his pride
He was the victim of a love and run
And I could plainly see that she had almost killed him
Left the scene of a broken heart not looking back at what she'd done
Oh, this boy has been hurt, I'll save him
I'll take his heart and mend it if I can
Oh, this boy has been hurt, I'll save him
I'll take his tears and dry them as fast as he can cry them
I'll heal his hurt and make him as good as new again"
"A squeaky gate a welcome mat a big shaggy dog that lives out back
And some might even call it a shack but this is a house where love lives
The paint is peeling off of the cells the mailbox is full of bills
And it's no mansion on the hill but this is a house where love lives
There's a little boy who looks just you with freckles on his nose and eyes of blue
A little girl almost two and everybody says she looks just like you
So thank you dear for loving me though I know rich we'll never be
But that doesn't matter to you and me cause we live in a house where love lives
[ steel ]
So thank you dear for loving me...
We live in a house where love lives"
"Maybe because it's too good to be true
Maybe because I want it so much
Maybe I fear you don't really mean it
For I feel I'm never enough
But I want you more
Than I ever wanted
Anything I can recall
But something inside
Keeps saying you'll hurt me
Do I dare to trust it at all
Teach me to trust
Darling you must
Or else I'll go out of my mind
When I'm not near you
I always fear you
Have somebody else on the line
Is it a fear
Or is it a knowing
A jealousy born out of truth
'Cause I watch you flirt
And it's how you embrace
Them with your eyes
That say I could lose
Teach me to trust
Make me feel loved
Tell me I've no need to fear
Just make me feel safe
Whatever it takes
Tell me what I need to hear
'Cause I need to feel
Important and special
Your cherished and only true love
And sometimes I think
I'll die from this feeling
If you don't teach me to trust
Can't you reach me
And teach me to trust"
"Can't say we're lovers, can't say we're friends
Don't even know if I'll see you again
But against your warm body I felt so alive
And you got me over a heartache tonight
My heart was broken, my hurt was deep
I had lost something I wanted to keep
Lookin' for comfort when you caught my eye
And you got me over a heartache tonight
Chorus:
Sweet conversation, a drink and a dance
Led to an evening of making romance
And I don't even care if it's wrong or it's right
'cause you got me over a heartache tonight
2nd chorus:
Yes, you got me over a heartache tonight
Stirring up passion brought me back to life
Oh, and it may not last, but who know it just might
But you got me over a heartache tonight
Yes, you got me over a heartache tonight"
"To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven
A time to be born, a time to die
A time to plant, a time to reap
A time to kill, a time to heal
A time to laugh, a time to weep
To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven
A time to build up, a time to break down
A time to dance, a time to mourn
A time to cast away stones
A time to gather stones together
To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven
A time of love, a time of hate
A time of war, a time of peace
A time you may embrace
A time to refrain from embracings
A time to gain, a time to lose
A time to rend, a time to sew
A time to love, a time to hate
A time of peace, I swear it's not too late"
"(Dolly Parton)
Late one cold and stormy night I heard a dog a' barkin'
Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a' knockin'
I wondered who could be outdide in such an awful storm
Then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms
Before I could say a word she said, 'My name is Sandy
And this here is my puppy dog, it's name is little Andy'
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said
Ain't ya got no gingerbread
Ain't ya got no candy
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little Andy
Patty cake and bakersman
My mommy ran away again
And we was all alone and didn't know what else to do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you
Giddy up trotty horse, going to the mill
Can we stay all night
If you don't love us no one will
I promise we won't cry
London bridge is fallin' down
My daddy's drunk again in town
And we was all alone and didn't what we could do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you
She was just a little girl, not more than six or seven
But that night as they slept the angels took them both to heaven
God knew little Andy would be lonesome with her gone
Now Sandy and her puppy dog won't ever be alone
Ain't ya got no gingerbread
Ain't ya got no candy
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little (whispers) Andy"
"Now I've never stepped through the doors of a barroom or tasted the flavor of wine
And I've never danced to the songs on a jukebox or held someone that wasn't mine
But there's always the first time and if you don't change
Then I guess the first time can't be arranged can't be arranged
[ banjo ]
Now I've never dressed for the eyes of the stranger to sow seeds of lust in his mind
And I've never walked down backroad of temptation to leave dirty footprints behind
But there's always the first time..."
"You were not content with me when I was like I used to be
I was too old-fashioned, too simple and too plain
And so you took this country girl, taught me all about the world
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
I used to never drink or smoke, I'd even blush at dirty jokes
I never wanted to take part in all those worldly games
But you dressed me up in sexy clothes, took me where the swingers go
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
But you don't want me swingin' now, but you're the one that taught me how
It was you that wanted me to change
I'm only what you made of me, your mistake was changin' me
Yes, you're the one that taught me how to swing
You want me like I was before but I'm not like that anymore
This plain, old, simple, country girl won't ever be the same
So don't expect me to go back 'cause it's a bit too late for that
And you're the one that taught me how to swing"
"(Dolly Parton)
I know this dress I'm wearing doesn't hide the secret I've tried concealing
When he left he promised me he'd be back by the time it was revealing
The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow o'er the fields of clover
And time is running out for me, I wish that he would hurry down from Dover
He's been gone so long, when he left the snow was deep upon the ground
And I have seen a spring and summer pass and now the leaves are turning brown
At any time a tiny face will show itself 'cause waiting's almost over
But I won't have a name to give it if he doesn't hurry down from Dover, from Dover, from Dover
My folks weren't understanding, when they found out they sent me from the home place
My daddy said if folks found out he'd be ashamed to ever show his face
My mamma said I was a fool, she did not believe it when I told her
Momma, everything's gonna be all right 'cause soon he would be coming down from Dover
I found a place to stay out on a farm takin' care of that old lady
She never asked me nuthin' so I never talked to her about my baby
I sent a messgae to my mom with a name and address of Ms. ol' Grover
And to make sure he got that information when he came down from Dover
I loved him more than anything and I could not refuse him when he needed me
He was the only one I'd loved and I just can't believe that he was usin' me
He wouldn't leave me here like this, I know it can't be so, it can't be over
He wouldn't make me go through this alone, he'll be coming down from Dover
My body aches the time is here it's lonely in this place where I'm lying
Our baby has been born, but something's wrong, it's too still, I hear no crying
I guess in some strange way she knew she'd never have a father's arms to hold her
So dying was her way of tellin' me he wasn't coming down from Dover, from Dover, from Dover
Down from Dover"
"Du-u-u Du-u-u Du-u-u-u-u-u wa Du-u wa
My love for you is deeper than the depths of any ocean,
And as faithful as the stars that grace the night,
As constant as the sun making its journey through heavens,
and we'll always be together you and I.
--
[Chorus]
Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine.
Paint a pretty rainbow, brushed with love across the sky,
Together you and I belong, like a songbird and a song
and we'll always be together you and I
--
Life with you is sweeter than the fragrance of the flowers
And as happy as the laughter of a child
As peaceful as a river and as lasting as forever
you know we'll always be together you and I
[Chorus]
I always be beside or close behind you.
Wherever you go, you'll always know I'll always find you
[Chorus]
We'll always be together, you and I
Forever together, forever you and I
(forever you and I du-du)
Forever together, together you and I will always be
(together, together)
Together, you and I........"
"(Dolly Parton)
Some men find her sexy, some men disagree
But if she's not, it's not because she doesn't want to be
She wears a push-up bra from Freddericks, five inch high heel shoes
Maybelline and Rubinstein, and Avon's best perfume
She's a working girl
She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl
Some find her to aggressive, she don't know how to stop
Cause she's the kind that don't look down until it's from the top
She's elegant and stylish, French perfume and a fur
Designer clothes by Halston and Diane Von Furstenburg
And she's a working girl
She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl
She has taken her place among the tallest of trees
But she weeps like a willow when she's brought to her knees
Cause she's a working girl
You'll find her dressed according to standard uniform
Cause she must dress in comfort for the job she must perform
She has so many faces, she wears so many names
She goes so many places and she does so many things
Cause she's a working girl
She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl
She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl
She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl"
"My country tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing
Land where my fathers died
Land of the pilgrim's pride
From every mountain side
Let freedom ring
My native country, thee
Land of the noble free
Thy name I love
I love thy rocks and rills
Thy woods and templed hills
My heart with rapture fills
Like that above
Let music swell the breeze
And ring from all the trees
Sweet freedom's song
Let mortal tongues awake
Let all that breathe partake
Let rocks their silence break
The sound prolong
Our Father God to, Thee
Author of liberty
To Thee I sing
My country 'tis of Thee
Sweet land of liberty
For all eternity
Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
My country 'tis, my country 'tis of Thee"
"The truth is too painful
This moment too real
Saying good-bye
But loving you still
Too late to start over
We've tried that before
And I just don't have it in me
To try anymore
Chorus:
But I know I'll miss you
And I know I'll cry
I know you loved me
And I know you've tried
It's the hardest thing
I'll ever do in my life
But I know no good way
Of saying good-bye
2nd chorus:
I know I'll miss you
And I know I'll cry
I know you loved me
And I know I'll ask why
I know I'll have moments
When I'll want to die
But I know no good way
Of saying good-bye
Tag:
And the longest night
I'll ever spend will be tonight
'cause I know no good way of saying"
"Silent night holy night all is calm all is bright
Round young virgin mother and child holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar heavenly hosts sing hallelujah
Christ the Savior is born Christ the Savior is born
Silent night holy night son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face with the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at Thy birth Jesus Lord at Thy birth"
"Well I've sacrificed time with family and friends, gave up vacations for work without end, 24/7/365 but I was willing to make the sacrifice but empty or full, I've carried my pail, you don't drink the water if you don't dig the well, through blood, sweat and tears I have built a good life but it didn't come without sacrifice
And I was gonna be rich no matter how much it cost, and I was gonna win no matter how much I lost all through the years I've kept my eye on the prize, you ask if it's worth the sacrifice, the sacrifice."
"I could hold out my arms, say ""I love you this much""
I could tell you how long I will long for your touch
How much and how far would I go to prove
The depth and the breadth of my love for you?
From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Love everlasting, I promise you that
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back
I want you to know you can always depend
On promises made and love without end
No need to wonder how faithful I'll be
Now and on into eternity
From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Forever and always, I'll be where you're at
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back
I would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat
I would call out your name to echo through the vast
Thank heaven for you and to God, tip my hat
From here to the moon and back
And I'll spend forever just proving that fact
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back..."
"The first noel, the angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
And by the light of that same star,
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a king was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
This star drew night to the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
Then entered in those wise men three,
Full reverently upon their knee;
And offered there in his presence,
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel."
"(Dolly Parton)
I love you, I love you
My heart seems to whisper
But my lips cannot form those words
I know my heart
Is calling out to you
In a voice you've already heard
Does your heart feel as if
It could burst any second
Is it racing, will not slow up
Do you just want to be
With me endlessly
Well I'm thinking
We might be in love
We might be in love
The best I can tell
I thinkin' thoughts
That I've never pondered
And I'm feeling like I've never felt
It's like I drink
From some magic posion
Sipping from your loving cup
Intoxicated, infatuated
I'm thinking we might be in love
We might be in love
What else could it be
These feelings of wonder
Passion and romance
Excitement and pure ectasy
We might be in love
And it might be forever
I think there's a future for us
If you just want to be
In and all over me
It might be, we might be in love
I promise for keeps
If you're feeling like me
Then it might be
We might be in love
I dare say
We might be in love"
"(Dolly Parton/Dorothy Jo Hope)
In this mental institution, lookin' out through these iron bars
How could he put me in here, how could he go that far
Yes I need help but not this kind, he didn't love me from the start
But it's not my mind that's broken, it's my heart
Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you
I'm depending on you Daddy, there's nothing I can do
And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need
But Daddy I can't come to you, you'll have to come to me
When he said he loved another, I was crazy with jealousy
That's 'cause I was crazy over him and I couldn't stand to set him free
And I couldn't stand to lose him and I cried and cried for days
And he said that I was crazy but he just put me in here to get me out of his way
Daddy come and get me
Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you
I'm depending on you Daddy 'cause there's nothing else I can do
And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need
But Daddy I can't come to you, you'll have to come to me"
"Some day you're gonna want me but I ain't gonna be around
Some day you'll find you miss the kiss that you're forever turnin' down
When you decide you want the love that once you could've had
Well that's gonna be to bad and you're gonna be sorry
You're gonna be sorry for all the dirty deals you've handed me
All the nights you stayed away you wished you'd spent with me
While you were busy makin' out, I was busy makin' plans for checkin' out
And when you find this out, you're gonna be sorry
You'll wake up cryin for me like I've done so many nights for you
You'll walk the floor and you'll call my name but I ain't gonna hear you
You'll curse the night and you'll hate yourself for ever doin' me wrong
But I'm gonna be long gone and you're gonna be sorry
You're gonna be sorry for all the dirty deals you've handed me
All the nights you've stayed away you wished you'd spent with me
While you were busy makin' out, I was busy makin' plans for checkin' out
And when you find I'm gone, you're gonna be sorry"
"Oh I know, I'm only dreaming.
'Cos I'll awake, and you'll be gone.
And my tears will still be streaming.
As my broken, heart beats on.
Yes I know, I'm only dreaming.
But Ill just, keep dreaming on.
I will dream about the pleasures.
That we shared in days gone by.
And I'll remember and I'll treasure,
Every kiss and your kind eyes.
And I will dream that you still hold me,
In your arms as you did then.
And I recall each thing you told me,
Hear your voice as I did then.
Yes I know, I'm only dreaming.
But I'll dream, and I will too.
I'll be here, and I'll be waiting,
And I will dream, of your return.
Some will say I'm being foolish,
While some will say that I'm just blind.
And that I want to face what the truth is
That you are, no longer mine.
But I will dream, you'll be returning
To some sweet day, to their surprise.
You will say your love's still burning,
You'll dry each tear drop from my eyes.
But I know, I'm only dreaming,
Cause Ill awake and be alone.
And my tears will still be streaming,
And you will still be just as gone.
Yes I know Im only dreaming,
But I must keep dreaming...on"
"Everybody wants to find a love
Somebody, somebody who will always care
We get locked up in our own worlds
With feelings and secrets we're afraid to share
But all I have to do is see you smile
And maybe, just maybe if I brush your hand
Something happens, I cannot explain
And somehow, oh, somehow I can understand
I, I think you're gonna find
Gonna find you, gonna find you
I'm reading your mind
I know you by heart
And you're so much a part of me
I know you by heart, yes, I do
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by heart
I know every time you're gonna call
I pick up the phone before it ever rings
And when you need some lovin'
I'll be there beside you, anticipating everything
Oh, it's like I always said
You're the one I want
All I want is you
I'm inside your head
I know you by heart
Girl, you're so much a part of me
I know you by heart, yes, I do
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by heart
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by heart
I know you by heart
And you're so much a part of me
I know you by heart, I know you, I know you, I know you
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by"
"(Though I'm only second best you're still first with me)
I tried to make you love me I've done everything I could
I thought if I tried long enough maybe someday that you would
But there was someone else before me and it's her you're lovin' still
And I know no matter what I'd do I'm only second best
Only second best that's all I will ever be
Even though I'm second best you're still first with me
And I'll be loving you when they fall my hand I guess
I love you even though I know I'm only second best
I know you've tried to love me and I'd hope you would in time
I know that when you're holding me it's her that's on your mind
Now I know you can't get over her but I love you nonless
But it makes no difference what I'd do I'm only second best
Only second best...
I love you even though I know I'm only second best"
"(Dolly Parton)
Daddy I feel that I must talk to you
Are you sure this is what you want to do?
Now it's not for us kids that I beg you to stay
Please don't just walk out on Mama this way
She's mothered your children, she's spent her whole life
Trying to be a good mother and wife
And she stood by you when the rest let you down
Daddy, how can you walk out on her now?
I'm your oldest daughter, my age twenty-three
Your new love is even younger than me
She's young, she's pretty, her hands soft as dew
While Mama's are withered from working for you
Mom's not young any more like your new love
But your new love won't love you like my mama does
You've taken her best years, so don't leave her now
Please, Daddy say that you won't let her down"
"If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my children and my wife
I'd thank my lucky stars
To be living here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.
From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston
And New York to L.A.
Well there's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A."
"On a cold winty night as the winds blew across the wild moor
Poor Mary came wandering home with her child
Till she came at her own father's door
Papa oh papa she cried come down and open the door
Or the child in my arms will perish and die
From the winds that blow across the wild moor
But the man was deaf to her cry not a sound of her voice did he hear
While the watch dogs did howl and the village bells tolled
The winds blew across the wild moor
Oh how the old man must have felt
When he came to the door the next morn
And found Mary dead but the child yet alive
Clutched close to his dead mother's breast
Now the old man in grief pined away
And the day to it's mother went soon
And no one they say has lived there to this day
And the cottage is left to ruins
Now the villagers point out the place
Where the willows droop over the door
Saying there Mary died once a gay village bride
From the winds that blew across the wild moor
From the winds that blew across the wild moor"
"As gentle as soft breezes blowing as warm as the summer sunshine
As sweet as the dew on the roses was the love I used to call mine
Sweet memories keep on holding revealing the past in my mind
But my arms are no longer holding the love I used to call mine
Gone are the soft gentle breezes and gone is the warm summer sunshine
And gone like the dew on the roses is the love that I used to call mine
Sweet memories keep on holding revealing the past in my mind
Some other arms arms are now holding the love I used to call mine
The love that I used to call mine"
"(Dolly Parton)
When you need to be love, let me love you
When you need a friend, reach out to me
When you need reassuring that it's alright
Anything you need, that what I'll be
For I want to be the one you always come to
When you find you need a place to go
Let mine be the hand you always cling to
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
I can be the one that makes you happy
I'll be your umbrella when it rains
I will be someone that you can count on
In other words, I'll be your everything
For I want to be the one you always come to
When you find you need a place to go
Let mine be the hand you always cling to
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold"

I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus, I'll tell you why I do
'Cause I believe that dreams and plans and wishes can come true
I believe in miracles, I believe in magic too
Oh I believe in Santa Claus and I believe in you
I believe in family, in country and in smiles
I believe in turnin' negatives to positives in life
I believe in lookin' farther up the farther down we get
I believe when someone hurts us we should forgive and forget
And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe love should prevail at any cost
And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in saying what you mean and meaning what you say
I believe a better attitude can make a better way
And I believe in viewing life as a journey that we're on
And lookin' at our troubles as another stepping stone
And I believe that everything in life is what it's meant to be
I believe there is a God somewhere although he's hard to see
I believe I am so therefore I should do all that I can
To be a better piece in the puzzle of God's plan
And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
And I believe in Santa Claus
Let the little children sing it
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus
Let the whole world sing it with us
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus
Let the whole world sing it with us
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
I believe in Santa Claus"
"When I left, I left walkin' wounded
I made my escape from the rain
Still a prisoner of hurt
I had months worth of work
Just freein' my mind of the pain
I had hours of sittin' alone in the dark
Listenin' to sad songs and comin' apart
Lord knows I made crying an art
Woe is a slow healing heart
A slow healing heart dyin' to mend
Longin' for love, lonely again
When the spirit is broken
And the memories start
Nothin' moves slower
Than a slow healing heart
How I prayed for blind faith to lead me
To places where I'm not afraid
Now I'm doin' fine both in body and mind
Some hurts take longer to fade
But there's a part of my feelings ever on guard
Against looks that are tender and words that are hard
'Cause I still remember those cutting remarks
Oh, it's painful a slow healing heart
A slow healing heart dyin' to mend
Longin' for love, lonely again
When the spirit is broken
And the memories start
You know nothin' moves slower
Than a slow healing heart
Oh, nothin' moves slower
Than a slow healing heart"
"(Dolly Parton)
I wish you all the luck I wish you only the best
Satisfaction in love, and true happiness
I wish you blue skies and rainbows, I wish you joy pure and sweet
I wish you all that you wish for, but only if you're with me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I wish you nothin' but trouble if you've decided to leave
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I have had you too long, I have given too much
I have loved you too strong to think of giving you up
I've always envied those lovers that wish you well when you leave
And wish you luck with another; but there are others like me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
And every face you look into, I hope you're haunted by me
Yes, I'm possessive and jealous; at least I speak honestly
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy, never ever ever happy
Never ever ever happy
With anybody but me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I wish you nothin' but trouble if you've decided to leave
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy"
"Love is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
I feel it when you're with me
It happens when you kiss me
That rare and gentle feeling that I feel inside
Your touch is soft and gentle
Your kiss is warm and tender
Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies
Love is like a butterfly
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
Your laughter brings me sunshine
Everyday is spring time
And I am only happy when you are by my side
How precious is this love we share
How very precious, sweet and rare
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies
Love is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing"
"(Dolly Parton)
Eve you wicked woman, you done put your curse on me
Why didn't you just leave that apple hangin' in the tree
You make us hate our husbands, our lovers and our boss
Why I can't even count the good friends I've already lost
Cause of PMS blues, PMS blues
I don't even like myself, but it's something I can't help
I got those God almighty, slap somebody PMS blues
Most times I'm easy going, some say I'm good as gold
But when I'm PMS I tell ya, I turn mean and cold
Those not afflicted with it are affected just the same
You poor old men didn't have to grin and say ""I feel your pain""
PMS blues, PMS blues
You know you must forgive us for we care not what we do
I got those can't stop crying, dishes flying PMS blues
But you know we can't help it
We don't even know the cause
But as soon as this part's over, then comes the menopause
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord
We're going to always be a heap of fun
Like the devil taking over my body, suffering, suffering, suffering
Everybody's suffering, huh?
But a woman had to write this song, a man would be scared to
Lest he be called a chauvenist or just fall victim to
Those PMS blues
You know we'd kill for less than that
PMS blues
You don't want to cross my path
Cause a pitbull ain't no match
For these teeth a clenchin', fluid retention
Head a swellin', can't stop yellin'
Got no patience, I'm so hateful
PMS blues, premenstrual syndrome
Got those moods a swingin', tears a slingin'
Nothin' fits me when it hits me
Rantin', ravin', misbehavin'
PMS blues"
"(Dolly Parton)
Many years you have lingered around my cabin door
Oh hard times come again no more
Oh hard times come again no more
Oh hush a bye hard times, go ye away
Cause my hungry baby wants a Gingerbread Cake
Not a cow in the barn yard no money to spend
Not an egg in the hayloft, no little red hen
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
Oh, hush a bye hard times go ye to rest
Cause my ragged baby wants a new ruffled dress
And she wants some new shoes with buckles to wear
And she wants some silver bows for her golden hair
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
Hush a bye hard times go ye away
I don't intend to be treated this way
So, hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Don't cry no more
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more
Many years you have lingered around my cabin door
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Don't cry no more
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more"
"Look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
Hey, look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
It's the Orange Blossom Special
Bringin' my baby back
Well, I'm going down to Florida
And get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californy
And get some sand in my shoes
I'll ride that Orange Blossom Special
And lose these New York blues
""Say man, when you going back to Florida?""
""When am I goin' back to Florida? I don't know, don't reckon I ever will.""
""Ain't you worried about getting your nourishment in New York?""
""Well, I don't care if I do-die-do-die-do-die-do-die.""
Hey talk about a-ramblin'
She's the fastest train on the line
Talk about a-travellin'
She's the fastest train on the line
It's that Orange Blossom Special
Rollin' down the seaboard line"
"(Dolly Parton)
Being born was the worse and the first mistake I ever made
The doctor didn't spank me, he just slapped me in the face
And the cup of love was always quenching someone else's thirst
Leaving me to swallow the bitter taste of hurt
'Cause I was raised an orphan
Never wanted as a kid until the year I turned 13
Then everybody did, strangers pass me back and forth
Men just took me as they pleased
And others had a Cinderella slave to cook and clean and weep
Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose, you have to play
The hand a life has dealt you
And It's a gamble either way
On a dust road at 15 in a yellow cotton dress
With the desert sun like an angry dragon breathing down my neck
And the dry cracked plains would make me think of a prehistoric time
Or should I fear what lay before me less than what I'd left behind
A 15 year old girl don't have no trouble hitching rides
But sometimes when you're riding free
You'll pay the highest price
On back roads and in back seats
And in a cheap highway motel
But what's a few more strangers in a life of nothing else
Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose, you have to play
The hand a life has dealt you
And It's a gamble either way
16 caught me crying, underneath the scarlet light
On the door steps of a stranger on a cold and rainy night
When I walked into the parlour here
Other pieces seemed to fit
I was good at pleasing strangers
So I made the most of it
Either way it's all a gamble
So view the stakes and know the odds
And lay your cards upon the table
Do all the dealing from the top
Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose, you have to play
The hand a life has dealt you
And It's a gamble either way"
"It's just a little bitty pissant country place
Ain't nothin' much to see
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatin' old time country place
Ain't nothing too high tone
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
But there's nothing dirty going on
Nothing dirty going on
We get simple farmers, local business men
Congress folks from Austin, young boys looking for sin
Now we used to get a lot of rough necks, when the oil boom was high
By pay day id get a little rowdy, thank God the field ran dry
[Chorus:]
It's just a little bitty pissant country place, nothing much to see
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatin old time country place, nothing too high tone
Just lots of good will, and maybe one small thrill, but there's nothing dirty going on
I don't hire no married girl, they're not on the ball
They got homes and husbands, they're not stable at all
You know they don't understand a thing about a proper business day
Now what's the point in opening up the store if you give the goods away
[Chorus]
Keep your language clean girls, keep your bedrooms neat
And don't hang around the town cafe and say hi on the street
Mind you P's and Q's and manners, and you don't need no other tools
Cause every girl that lives here knows my special no-no rules
Yea every girl that lives here knows Miss Mona's no-no rules
Ruby, Ray start em!
Beds are not to be wallowed in
That's the kind of thing that big fat lazy hogs do
And it don't make money!
Betrix!
I won't tolerate no tying up my telephone with other people's business
Eloise honey!
And please don't show us no tattoos
No hearts and flowers on your thigh
It's downright tacky
Brands for the cattle and that ain't what we're selling at Miss Mona's
Do you catch my drift?
I pay the food and the rent and the utilities
You keep your mind on your work responsibilities
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
And we can get along
Dawn!
Any bad habits you come in with, get rid off right now
Tatty Joe!
I can't stand no chewing gum it looks just like a cow
Lindy Lue!
Any one taking sick leave better be real sure they're sick
And every time you hear that bell...
You better get here double quick
And as for pimps
Pimps are something you don't need
To get your daily business done
Are you listening, girls?
Keep them leaches and blood suckers off the back roads,
I know how to use a gun
And nobody messes with my girls
And any questions you might have about the way I run this place
Don't grip and whine behind my back
Just tell me face to face, I'm open-minded, say it all
Then go upstairs and pack, the door's that a-way
She pays the food and the rent and the utilities
We keep our mind on our work responsibilities
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
And we can get along
[Chorus]
It's just a little bitty pissant country place, nothing much to see
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatin no time country place, nothing to hide at all
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
But there's nothing dirty going on
Nothing dirty going on"
"(Dolly Parton)
Up on Sugar Hill we'd go walkin'
Hand in hand while the south wind blowed
Bob whites callin', black crows cawkin',
Countin' the warts on a toad in the road
Down in the mill pond swimmin' naked
Showin' more than we should have showed
We were just kids explorin' nature
Learnin' more than we should have knowed
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill memories
Stealing sugar on the mountainside
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill sugar
Sweeter than candy and cake and pie
A yellow dress drapin' off of my shoulder
Seein' myself in the lookin' glass
Older now and a little bit bolder
Thinkin' about our summers past
Up on Sugar Hill we'd go walkin'
Hand in hand up the mountainside
Teenage lovers plannin' and talkin'
Dreamin' of a future for you and I
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill memories
Stealin' sugar on the mountain top
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill sugar
Sweeter than ice cream and soda pop
Years have past, we're married with children
Our days are happy and our memories fond
We still find it quite appealin'
To go to Sugar Hill and swim naked in the pond
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill memories
Stealin' sugar on the mountaintop
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill sugar
Sweeter than ice cream and soda pop
Up on Sugar Hill there's a wealth of treasure
Down it's memory lane I go walking still
What it means to me is more than I can measure
Golden moments up on Sugar Hill
Up on Sugar Hill with the fireflies glowin'
Sound of katydids and the whipperwill
Honeysuckle bloomin' and a mountain stream flowin'
A little spot of heaven up on Sugar Hill
Up On Sugar Hill with the bobwhite's callin'
Black crows cawkin', and the soft wind blows
Up on Sugar Hill there are love birds talkin'
Up on Sugar Hill where the good times roll
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill memories
Stealin' sugar on the mountainside
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill sugar
Sweeter than candy and cakes and pies
A little spot of heaven up on Sugar Hill"
"A squeaky gate a welcome mat a big shaggy dog that lives out back
And some might even call it a shack but this is a house where love lives
The paint is peeling off of the cells the mailbox is full of bills
And it's no mansion on the hill but this is a house where love lives
There's a little boy who looks just you with freckles on his nose and eyes of blue
A little girl almost two and everybody says she looks just like you
So thank you dear for loving me though I know rich we'll never be
But that doesn't matter to you and me cause we live in a house where love lives
[ steel ]
So thank you dear for loving me...
We live in a house where love lives"
"There is a house down in New Orleans
Down in the Vieux Carr'e
A house they call the rising sun
Where love and money are made
My father he was a gambler
Mother died when I was young
And I've worked since then
To please the men
At the house of the rising sun
There is a house
Down in New Orleans
They call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh God, you know I'm one
So mothers you go telling all your daughters
Not to do what I've done
To live a life of sin, shame and strife
In the house of the rising sun"
"Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling, yoo, hoo
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup
It's grand just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop, pop, pop, pop
There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When you pass around the cider and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling, yoo, hoo
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you"
"(Dolly Parton)
Nothing new, nothing different, nothing better, nothing more
Nothing else to give you I didn't give before
I gave my love completely, my heart was always yours
It wouldn't do, I still lost you
You want to give it one chance; Don't know why we should
We'd never get that far again or make the love that good
We had our chance, we blew it; And I'll never understand
Careless fools, I still lost you
You want to fan the flames of love, stir up passion's fire
Conjure up familiar lusts, stir up past desires
What we had then, we don't have now; And I would just compare
I refuse, I still lost you
Too late for starting over, it hardly ever works
Too many missing pieces, too much water, too much hurt
I already lost you once, and that makes matters worse
What's the use, I still lost you
Oh you want to fan the flames of love, stir up passion's fire
Conjure up familiar lusts, stir up past desires
What we had then, we don't have now; And I would just compare
I refuse, I still lost you
Oh what's the use, I still lost you
I lost you"
"With great anticipation he waited at the door
His only son was due from overseas
For months now he'd been waitin' since he'd gone off to war
And his eyes were filled with tears of great relief
Welcome home, son
His loving arms held open and his heart so full of love
Welcome home, son
I've been prayin' and been hopin' and I never did give up
I knew that you'd return to me
The place where you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long.
I hear him say as they embrace
""I've waited so long for this day
My son, my very own... Welcome home.""
But a dreary rain was falling while another soldier fell
And a mother wakes up crying in the night
She thought she'd heard him calling in that moment she could tell
Her only son had passed into the light
Welcome home, son
His loving arems held open and his heart so full of love
Welcome home, son
As Jesus stood there glowing, their hands reached out and touched
I knew that you'd return to me
The place that you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long
As they embraced I heard him say
""I've waited so long for this day
My son, my very own... Welcome home.""
Now I think of all the families that have lost a darling one
And I think how Jesus died for all our sins
And I think how much God loved us to send his only son
To live and die, and then to live again
Welcome home son
I hear God saying when they nailed Christ to the cross that day
Welcome home son
And when he sent his angels to roll that stone away
I knew that you'd return to me
The place where you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long
I hear God say as they embrace
""I've waited so long for this day
Well done my faithful son... Welcome home.""
Welcome home!
I hope to hear God saying when it's my time to go!
Welcome home!
While the angel band is playing and God comes to claim my soul!
The angels will be singing and joybells will be ringing!
Rejoicing! I'll shout and sing along!
When there are no more wars to fight
And we're all children of the light
When the father and the son say
""Welcome home!""
Tag: Welcome home, welcome home, welcome home."
"(M. Chapman)
I can't even begin to tell you
How I've been feelin' lately
But I have stumbled across something rare
And you use it to bait me
Something tells me go
Everyone says no, no, no
How can they be so cruel
When they tell me don't touch you
I tell them I'll die
In your red hot screaming love
In your red hot screaming love
If I'm losing my senses
They're lost in your deepest emotions
And the jets in my heart
They won't start till you set them in motion
Something tells me go
Everyone says no, no, no
How can they be so cruel
When they tell me don't touch you
I tell them I'll die"
"Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as goneI stand here in the doorway of the room where you lie sleeping
In hopes that I don't wake you up with the sounds of my weeping
It breaks my heart to see you laying there
Alone in the bed we used to share
'Cause you no longer want me and I wonder what went wrong
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone
There's so much more between us than just these lonely walls
The echoes of our dying love lingers in the halls
Living separately together in a house that's not a home
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone
Through the eyes of a broken heart, I watch my whole world fall apart
I'm trying to revive a love that's died
Hopelessly I'm holding on to a love I know is gone
Gone, but not because I haven't tried
Disappearing from your door way now the hurt is twice as strong"
"(Dolly Parton)
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus, I'll tell you why I do
'Cause I believe that dreams and plans and wishes can come true
I believe in miracles, I believe in magic too
Oh I believe in Santa Claus and I believe in you
I believe in family, in country and in smiles
I believe in turnin' negatives to positives in life
I believe in lookin' farther up the farther down we get
I believe when someone hurts us we should forgive and forget
And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe love should prevail at any cost
And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in saying what you mean and meaning what you say
I believe a better attitude can make a better way
And I believe in viewing life as a journey that we're on
And lookin' at our troubles as another stepping stone
And I believe that everything in life is what it's meant to be
I believe there is a God somewhere although he's hard to see
I believe I am so therefore I should do all that I can
To be a better piece in the puzzle of God's plan
And I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
And I believe in Santa Claus
Let the little children sing it
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus
Let the whole world sing it with us
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus, I believe in Santa Claus
Let the whole world sing it with us
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe in Santa Claus
I believe there's always hope when all seems lost
I believe in Santa Claus"

Some chewing gum and candy, some magazines and snacks,
Some startin' over money that I've been holdin' back,
A change of clothes and notepad to write a letter back to say so long
A one-way ticket sayin' good-bye to everything
Threw my weddin' band out the window of the train
All I want's my freedom, reclaim my maiden name
I'm movin' on 'cause I'm gone
You can tell the truth or you can lie
You can say I left you or I died
Say I'm in the Himalayas on some spiritual quest
And could spend years lookin' for the light
Say I'm in the witness program with the F.B.I.,
Say a U.F.O. abducted me from home
You can say what you chose, but I tell you the truth
You can say for sure I'm gone, 'cause I'm gone
You think that you're above me, like I'm not good enough
You make me feel unwanted, unwelcome and unloved
You're selfish, vain and greedy; you're hateful, rude and rough
And you're so wrong
But you'd rather live unhappy and tolerate the pain
Than separate and have me takin' half of everything
Well, I'm leavin' your possessions, left on the good-bye train,
Left you alone 'cause I'm gone
You can have the house, the car, the boat,
My records, books and stereo,
The dog and the cat, my ceramic shop out back,
My doll collection and my clothes
You can keep all our friends and all the pictures in the den,
And the fluffy pillows you sleep on
But when you lay your head on that big feather bed
You can rest assured I'll be gone; I'll be gone
You can tell the truth or you can lie
You can say I left or I died
Say I'm in the Himalayas on some spiritual quest
And could spend years lookin' for the light
Say I'm in the witness program with the F.B.I.
Say a U.F.O. abducted me from home
Well, you can say what you chose, but I tell you the truth
You can say for sure I'm gone
You can say what you like, but I'll tell you twice
You can say for sure, say for sure I'm gone, gone
Some chewing gum and candy, magazines and snacks,
Startin' over money I've been holding back,
Change of clothes and notepad to write a letter back to say so long
I got a one-way ticket sayin' good-bye to everything
I threw my weddin' band out of the window of the train
All I want's my freedom, reclaim my maiden name
I'm moving on 'cause I'm gone
Oh, I'm gone, gone, gone; I'm gone
I'm so gone, I'm gone; gone, I'm gone"
"Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
Like T-O-why or maybe S-you-are-P-are-I-S-E
But the words we're hiding from him now
Tear the heart right out of me
Our D-I-V-O-are-see-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-see-E
Watch him smile, he thinks it's Christmas
Or his 5th Birthday and he thinks see-you-S-T-O-D-why spells fun or play
I spell out all the hurtin' words and turn my head when I speak
'Cause I can't spell away this hurt that's drippin' down my cheek
Our D-I-V-O-are-see-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-are-see-E"
"I'm tempted, my darlin' to steal you away
Don't let me cross over, stay out of my way
'Cause you know that I love you and I'm not the stealin' kind
But I'm faced with heartache here at love's cheating line
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line
You belong to another and can never be mine
I know one step closer would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line
I've tried to forget you but what else can I do
When your eyes keep saying that you want me too
And I know if I lose you not a dream will I have left
I don't want to cheat, dear but I can't help myself
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line
You belong to another and can never be mine
I know one step closer would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line"
"I met you and we married we planned our future well
We built our home on happiness then suddenly it fell
It wasn't long there after our love began to tilt
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built
First came the weekly parties that never seemed to end
And then came the heartbreak brought by so-called friends
I guess that I'm as much to blame while we share the guilt
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built
First came the weekly parties...
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built"
"Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
And I dreamed about the cotton fields and home
I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sister and brother
And I dreamed about the girl who's been waiting for long.
I want to go home, I want to go home
Oh, how I want to go home.
Home folks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars, by night I ake the bars
If only they could read between the lines.
I want to go home, I want to go home
Oh, how I want to go home.
Cause you know I rode a freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find I've just been wasting my time
So I think I'll take my foolish pride
And put it on the south-bound freight and ride
And go on back to the loved ones
The ones that I left waiting so far behind.
I want to go hoe, I want to go home
Oh, how I want to go home."
"If you go, I'll follow you
You can't leave my love behind
If you go (if you go) I'll follow you
Even death could never end this love of mine
I have loved you for so long
With a love both true and strong
You are all I'll every have
And I'll love you good or bad
Where you go I'll go with you
No matter where you take me to
I'll go through hell And back again
I'll be with you Until the end
If you go, I'll follow you
You can't leave my love behind
If you go (if you go) I'll follow you
Even death could never end this love of mine
If you go, I'll follow you...."
"Darling it's not really over it just seems to be
Darling I don't really think that we want to be free
A raging storm of anger made us want to end it all
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
These tiny drops of pain that's falling down our face
Tomorrow will be gone almost without a trace
It's hurtin' now but soon we'll find it doesn't hurt at all
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
In each love some pain must fall that doesn't mean that it's the end
When the anger is all gone everything will be all right again
And the hurt that seems so big now tomorrow will seem small
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall
[ guitar ]
In each love some pain must fall...
Darling don't you know in each love some pain must fall"
"(Dolly Parton)
I would spin for you a blanket
Out of gold and silver threads
I would let my gentle bosom
Be a pillow for your head
I'd caress your perfect body
On a rosy bed at night
Play you love songs on a golden harp
And sing you Butterflies
In a diamond-studded chalice
On an emerald-plated tray
I would bring to you sweet nectar
And gifts of bright array
I would paint for you a castle
In a blue and yellow sky
Paint you happy ever after
And paint you Butterflies
Butterflies, my heart flutters with the notion
I get high on the wings of sweet emotion
Darling I, I just think of you and I get butterflies
I get close to you and I get butterflies
If only I were magic
I would make the wishes true
I would wave a magic wand
And be in Paradise with you
But I'm just a girl that loves you
I will love you all my life
But I do have a magic feeling
And it gives me butterflies
Butterflies, my heart flutters with the notion
I get high on the wings of sweet emotion
Darling I, I just think of you and I get butterflies
We should fly away together, you and I
Off to paradise forever, I get high
I get close to you and I get butterflies
I think of you and I get butterflies
I will spin for you a blanket out of gold and silver threads
If only I were magic, I would make the wishes true
I would wave a magic wand and be in paradise with you"
"You never close your eyes anymore
When I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness
Like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it, baby
But baby, baby
I know it
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa...
Now there's no welcome look
In your eyes when I reach for you
And now you're starting to
Criticize little things I do
It makes me just feel like crying, baby
'Cause baby,
Something beautiful is dying
You lost that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa
Baby, baby,
I get down on my knees
And pray to you
If you would only love me
Like you used to do
We had a love, a love,
A love you don't find everyday
So don't, don't, don't
Don't let it slip away
Bring back that lovin' feeling
Oh, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
And I can't go on, whoa...
You've lost the lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost the lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone
Bring back that lovin' feeling,
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone"
"Sometimes I think of you and tears fill my eyes
To think of the meaning youve given my life
Youve touched me in places no one ever reached
Youve given me reason and cause to believe
You are my rainbow, youve colored my life
And you are my sunshine, Im warm in your light
You are my fountain that never runs dry
Youre my inspiration, my reason to try
Ill love you til green grass turns lavender blue
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew
Til horses and chariots chase down the wind
Thats when Ill leave you, Ill love you til then
Ill love you til green grass turns lavender blue
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew
Til horses and chariots chase down the wind
Thats when Ill leave you, Ill love you til then
Ill love you til green grass turns lavender blue
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew
Til horses and chariots chase down the wind
Thats when Ill leave you, Ill love you til then
Thats when Ill leave you, yes
Ill leave you then
Ill need you til then
Ill love you til then"
"Happy, happy birthday baby
Although you're with somebody new
Thought I'd drop a line to say
That I wish this happy day
Would find me beside you
Happy, happy birthday baby
No, I can't call you my baby
Seems like years ago we met
On a day I can't forget
Cause that's when we fell in love
Do you remember
The names we had for each other
I was your pretty
You were my baby
Oh, how could we say goodbye
Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I'm not acting like a lady
So I'll close this note to you
With good luck and wishes too
Happy happy birthday baby"
"It's you that
I run to
Whenever I need to
Darling, you console me
When trouble surrounds me
When bad times have found me
Just reach out your arms and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Darling please take me
In your arms of safety
Reach out your arms
And hold me
Hold me
When my feelings are showing
When my tears are flowing
Just reach out
Reach out and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
You know all of my needs
You fill them completely
You know
That you control me
I depend on
Your lovin'
Without you
I'm nothin'
So reach out
Your arms and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Darling please take me
In your arms of safety
Reach out you arms
And hold me
Hold me
When life is demanding
When I need understanding
Reach out
Reach out and hold me
Hold me
Hold me"
"(Dolly Parton)
The hardest thing I've done or that I'll ever do
Was to just walk off and leave you
But I knew I had to leave you
'Cause I couldn't stay and watch you
Falling out of love with me
The worst pain that I've ever known
Or that I'll ever know
Was to see your love-a-dying
And to have to watch it dying
And I couldn't stand to watch you
Falling out of love with me
I'm hurting now, but still it's better
I left while love was still alive
It was dying and I'd rather
I didn't have to watch it die
The loneliest I've ever been
Or that I'll ever be
Now that I'm without you
But I couldn't stand to watch you
Falling out of love with me"
"Rudolf, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw him,
You would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolf
Play in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say:
""Rudolf with your nose so bright,
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then all the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee:
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
You'll go down in history!"""
"As night falls around us love's tender embrace replaces the sun's golden light
Then love show us beauty that only love can describe love you're so beautiful tonight
As you fill our hearts with tenderness and emotions inside
Lost in each other with the world closed outside
Oh this must be like heaven it's heaven to you and I love you're so beautiful tonight
Your nearness in the silence your rapid heartbeat
Your face touching mine then you whisper on my cheek
I'll love you till the stars in the heavens lose their lights
Oh love you're so beautiful tonight
As you fill our hearts...
I'll love you till the stars..."
"Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling, yoo, hoo
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup
It's grand just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop, pop, pop, pop
There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
When you pass around the cider and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling, yoo, hoo
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you"
"Let's start by stopping long enough to talk things over
Since there's a new love burning between us
With open-minded understanding between us
Let's both feel free to talk of this new love
Let there be no deep dark secrets between us
Let's never hide behind a false disguise
Let there be no hidden feelings between us
An honest love is a love that will survive
In our love let's share a friendship between us
Always close enough to talk things out
Let's be honest with ourselves and with each other
And our love will never know mistrust or doubt
Let there be no deep dark secrets...
An honest love is a love that will survive"
"Crazy crazy we'd have to be crazy to put up with the crazy things we do
Crazy crazy we'd have to be crazy but you know I'm crazy about you
Either I'm crazy or you are one or maybe it's me and you
For we'd have to be crazy to live like this and go through what we go through
Well our love's so strong but we can't get along there's never a minute of peace
If I ain't a querrellin' and a fussin' at you you're a querrellin' and a fussin' at me
Crazy crazy we'd have to be crazy...
Well we must love to live like this in our subconscious minds
How can you love somebody so much and despite 'em at the very same time
I guess our fightin's the only excitement we have in our life
Would you think all people could live like this we couldn't be too bright"
"(Floyd Parton)
I'll do everything I can to make you proud to be my man
And I'll fulfill all your fantasies
I guess we're promising a lot, but for now it's all we've got
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years
Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
Side by side we'll be together always
And if you'll hold me tight when you love me
That's all I'll ask of you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years
I'll be your friend, I'll be your lover
Until the end, there'll be no other
'Cause my heart has only room for one
Yes, I'll always love you, and I'll always be here for you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years
Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
Side by side we'll be together always
And if you'll hold me tight when you love me
That's all I'll ask of you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years
Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
Side by side, we'll be together always
And, yes, I'll always love you and I'll always be here for you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years, and I'll be here
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years
Through our rockin' years"
"The first noel, the angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far;
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
And by the light of that same star,
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a king was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
This star drew night to the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest;
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel.
Then entered in those wise men three,
Full reverently upon their knee;
And offered there in his presence,
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
Noel, noel, noel, noel,
Born is the king of Israel."
"It's just a little bitty pissant country place
Ain't nothin' much to see
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatin' old time country place
Ain't nothing too high tone
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
But there's nothing dirty going on
Nothing dirty going on
We get simple farmers, local business men
Congress folks from Austin, young boys looking for sin
Now we used to get a lot of rough necks, when the oil boom was high
By pay day id get a little rowdy, thank God the field ran dry
[Chorus:]
It's just a little bitty pissant country place, nothing much to see
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatin old time country place, nothing too high tone
Just lots of good will, and maybe one small thrill, but there's nothing dirty going on
I don't hire no married girl, they're not on the ball
They got homes and husbands, they're not stable at all
You know they don't understand a thing about a proper business day
Now what's the point in opening up the store if you give the goods away
[Chorus]
Keep your language clean girls, keep your bedrooms neat
And don't hang around the town cafe and say hi on the street
Mind you P's and Q's and manners, and you don't need no other tools
Cause every girl that lives here knows my special no-no rules
Yea every girl that lives here knows Miss Mona's no-no rules
Ruby, Ray start em!
Beds are not to be wallowed in
That's the kind of thing that big fat lazy hogs do
And it don't make money!
Betrix!
I won't tolerate no tying up my telephone with other people's business
Eloise honey!
And please don't show us no tattoos
No hearts and flowers on your thigh
It's downright tacky
Brands for the cattle and that ain't what we're selling at Miss Mona's
Do you catch my drift?
I pay the food and the rent and the utilities
You keep your mind on your work responsibilities
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
And we can get along
Dawn!
Any bad habits you come in with, get rid off right now
Tatty Joe!
I can't stand no chewing gum it looks just like a cow
Lindy Lue!
Any one taking sick leave better be real sure they're sick
And every time you hear that bell...
You better get here double quick
And as for pimps
Pimps are something you don't need
To get your daily business done
Are you listening, girls?
Keep them leaches and blood suckers off the back roads,
I know how to use a gun
And nobody messes with my girls
And any questions you might have about the way I run this place
Don't grip and whine behind my back
Just tell me face to face, I'm open-minded, say it all
Then go upstairs and pack, the door's that a-way
She pays the food and the rent and the utilities
We keep our mind on our work responsibilities
Don't let your mouth overload your capabilities
And we can get along
[Chorus]
It's just a little bitty pissant country place, nothing much to see
No drinking allowed, we get a nice quiet crowd, plain as it can be
It's just a piddly squatin no time country place, nothing to hide at all
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
Just lots of good will and maybe one small thrill
But there's nothing dirty going on
Nothing dirty going on"

The first strange town I was ever in the county was hangin' a man
And nobody cared if he lived or he died and I just didn't understand
So I washed my face in the morning dew bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew and kept on moving along
The second strange town I was in they were laughing at a poor crippled man
Begging for nickels and dimes on the street and I just didn't understand
So I washed my face...
The third strange town that I was in was settled peaceful and nice
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer and to me it didn't seem right
So I washed my face...
Now someday times are bound to change it can't be very far
And each injustice that I have seen will come before the bar
Then I'll wash my face in the morning dew bathe my soul in the sun
Wash my face in the morning dew and my journey will be done"
"(Dolly Parton)
Mmm....
We used to walk through fields of green
We used to sit by clear blue streams
We used to be so happy
Me and you
We used to do such silly things
We used to make love in the rain
We used to
Yes, we used to
Then you went away
Leaving me with the memories we made
Memories of those sweet yesterdays
Spent with you
Spent with you
And even though you're gone
I still think so often of you
And the things that we no longer do
Like we used to
Oh we used to
We used to be so much in love
We used to kiss and hold and touch
We used to find so many things to do
We used to laugh and plan and dream
We used to own the world it seemed
We used to
Yes we used to
Then you went away
Leaving me with the memories we made
Memories of those sweet yesterdays
Spent with you
Spent with you
Oh and even though you're gone
I still think so often of you
And the things that we no longer do
Like we used to
Oh we used to
La...mmm....
Ahh...."
"As I sit here tonight, the jukebox playin'
The tune about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words you are sayin'
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men
Think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start
Most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
Too many times married men
Think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong"
"My country tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing
Land where my fathers died
Land of the pilgrim's pride
From every mountain side
Let freedom ring
My native country, thee
Land of the noble free
Thy name I love
I love thy rocks and rills
Thy woods and templed hills
My heart with rapture fills
Like that above
Let music swell the breeze
And ring from all the trees
Sweet freedom's song
Let mortal tongues awake
Let all that breathe partake
Let rocks their silence break
The sound prolong
Our Father God to, Thee
Author of liberty
To Thee I sing
My country 'tis of Thee
Sweet land of liberty
For all eternity
Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
My country 'tis, my country 'tis of Thee"
"You came into my life at a time when I was down
And I thought I'd never love again but I think different now
You took my hand and helped me up and I thank you for your precious love
And words cannot express the way I feel but is it real
Is it real this love that you have offered me so freely
You tell me that you love me but darling do you really
Don't make me love and lose again don't make me go through that again
I've known that hurt and I know how it feels oh is it real
Well you could mend my broken heart with love as sweet as yours
And I want to believe it's real but how can I be sure
And you could heal the hurt I've known with the love that you have shown
And all the needs you have I will fullfill but is it real
Is it real this love that you have...
Is it real"
"(Dolly Parton)
Mother's hold on to your sons and you daughters
Should Hollywood claim them, you'll hold then no more
Cause they'll become claimed to the Hollywood potters
And there's no escape once they walk through that door
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama
Center of sorrow, city of schemes
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams
Some, they go hungry and some go insane
Some go to the bottle and some to the vains
Some become users and some become used
And some even make it, but most never do
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama
Center of sorrow, city of schemes
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams
You spin them around like a merry-go-round
You mold them and shape them and then throw them down
All of your glitter and all of your gold
Is that what you give in exchange for a soul
Cause they sell their soles for the likes of you
While you chew up and spit out what you cannot use
Mother's hold on to your sons and you daughters
Should Hollywood claim them, you'll hold then no more
Cause they'll become claimed to the Hollywood potters
And there's no escape once they walk through that door
Hollywood, Hollywood Dungeon of Drama
Center of sorrow, city of schemes
Hollywood, Hollywood Terrace of Trauma
Palace of promises, dealer in dreams"
"Lookin' outta my windowpane
Tears minglin' with the rain
I'm so lonesome I could cry, just like old Hank
Starin' down on the city street
Feelin' empty and incomplete
There's a place I need to be to fill my tank
A place I can go where I can be free
Where I can be happy and I just be me
Ho-o-ome
Where the warm wind's blowin' and the river's flowin' along
Like a lazy bum in the midday sun
And I've gone fishin' with my pole at the fishin' hole
Where I can lay down my heavy load
And know that I am always welcome home
I left home I was seventeen
I had a lot of ambitious dreams
Seen a lot of those dreams come true, I've had good luck
I ain't complain' that's for sure
I got a lot to be thankful for
One of those things is a magic door that opens up
Back to the time when I was a kid
To the sounds of crickets and the katydids
It's called ho-o-ome
On the front porch swingin'
And the fern pots hangin'
Ho-o-ome
With the church bells ringin'
And voices singin'
Those old songs that mend my mind like a stitch in time
Where the tea is sweet and the love complete
Oh me, I wanna go ho-o-ome
I often think about where I have been
Where I am goin' and that's about when I think about
Ho-o-ome
Where the soul finds comfort and the heart finds pleasure
Ho-o-ome
Where the depths of love is hard to measure
It's ho-o-ome
I hear you callin', I hear you callin'
I'll never be lost as long as I know
There's place like that where I can go
Where I can restore my weary soul
On the mountain slopes in the soft blue smoke
Of ho-o-ome
Home sweeet home. Ho-o-ome
Back to the hills with the whippoorwills
Of ho-o-ome
With the fireflies blinkin' and the night stars winkin'
Ho-o-ome
Honeysuckle vine and Muscadine wine
At ho-o-ome
Where the ginseng grows in the shady groves of ho-o-ome
With family and friends and joy that never ends
Ho-o-ome
There's no place like it, no place like it
Ho-ome"
"As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto
People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto
As her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto"
"Well, I wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Cause there ain't no smog, no smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bill
Now but once I had me a man on Rocky Top
Half bear the other half cat
Well, he was wild as a mink but he was sweet as soda-pop
I often think about that
Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Now once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
Lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
And some say they never will
Did you know corn don't grow at all on Rocky Top?
The dirt's too rocky by far
And that's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar
Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Now I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped luck a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a dad-burn pity
Life can't be simple again
Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Rocky Top, Tennessee
Tennessee, Rocky Top"

And let us not fear what is not clear; faith should be your guide, just follow this advice:
And
Think about love; Think about living
Think about love-- sharing and giving
Drop the Doomsday attitude and let the spirit flow
These are wonderful times we're living in
God still walks in the hearts of Men
And Eden's garden waves within so let the flowers grow
Well we rant and we rave about the ""good ol' days"" and how different it was ""back then""
Well the greatest days we've ever known are the days we're living in
Well we worry about earthquakes, aliens from outer space, nuclear holocaust
Well we're so consumed with the fear of dying; the joy of living is lost
In the meantime, in between time, let us make time to make amends
Lead the good life, just treat this planet right and try to all be friends and say with me again:
Ohhh!
Think about life; Think about living
Think about love-- caring and giving
Drop this Doomsday attitude and get on with the show
We've walked on the moon; been to Mars
Technically we've come so far
But still we wonder who we are
The farther along we go
You know people been talking about the end of time ever since time began
We've been living in the last days ever since the first day ever since the dawn of Man
Well nobody knows when the end is comingwell that's what the Scriptures say
But that's a secret known only to God, he says to just watch and pray
In the meantime, what's the hurry?
In the meantime now don't you worry
In the meantime live, laugh- be merry
In the meantime, in the meantime
In the meantime troubles gonna show us
In the meantime the sky is still above us
In the meantime you know God's gonna love us
In the meantime, in the meantime, in the meantime"
"(Traditional)
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
My love, my love, what have I done
To make you treat me so
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
You've caused me to leave my home
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia Line
The engine passed at six o'clock
The caboose went by at nine
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo"
"(Dolly Parton)
Spent all my money on everyone else
Why I just kept handing it out right and left
They didn't appreciate none of my help
I have found
Had me a man
I was so much in love
But he just walked off after using me up
I cried like a baby
It hurt me so much and I'm down
Yeah, I'm sure down
I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up
I just need some time
Just need a little streak of good luck
And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am
You try to do right but tell me where does that get you
People just use you and then they forget you
Well it wont take me long
To get my feet back on solid ground
But now I'm down
When I get my life back in order again
Well I'll still be willing to help out my friends
And if you need some body or wished it had been, look around
I'll be spending my money on everyone else
Well I'll just be handing it out right and left
I'll find a new love i wont live by myself
I'm just down, now, yeah I'm down
I know that I'm down but I'm gonna get up
I just need some time
Just need a little streak of good luck
And you know that it's rough when your bitting the dust like I am
You try to do right but tell me where does that get you
People just use you and then they forget you
Well it wont take me long
To get my feet back on solid ground
But now I'm down
I know that I'm down
But I'm bound to get up"
"If I, could be with you forever
My restles heart
Would never want to roam
I've never been loved
The way you love me
[Chorus]
I wish I felt this way at home
When you kiss me
It's words without speaking
And I don't believe that
God would call this wrong
Your arms are the refuge
I was seeking
[Chorus]
But I don't, and I won't
We did all that we could
He and I
We tried hard
But it's just no good
I may never be free
'Cause I've no reason
And I don't expect you to wait that long
But I'll say one more time
As I'm leavin'
[Chorus]
Yes, I wish I felt this way at home"
"Saw you turnin' down main street
In your big, black fancy car
You were dressed up fit to kill
With a pretty girl on your arm
You spun around and you headed up town
Where the neon lights all shine
Left me choking in a cloud of dust
You never pay me no mind
Chorus:
You're livin' in the fast lane
I guess I'm just too slow
I never wore silk or fancy furs
Just plain ole calico
I'll never be a fast lane lover
And they're the only kind you take up town
I am just a country road
That you keep turnin' down
If you ever hit a dead end street
If it's love that you're looking for
You can always turn around
And beat a path right to my door
Do I have to draw you a map
You seem to know your way around
So when you're tired of spinnin' your wheels
Baby, we can go to town
Repeat Chorus
I'll never be a fast lane lover
And they're the only kind you take up town
I am just a country road
That you keep turnin' down
I am just a country road
That you keep turnin' down
Repeat Chorus"
"The first strange town I was ever in
The county was hangin' a man
And nobody cared if he lived or he died
And I just didn't understand
So I washed my face in the morning dew
Bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew
And kept on moving along
The second strange town I was in
They were laughing at a poor crippled man
Begging for nickels and dimes on the street
And I just didn't understand
So I washed my face in the morning dew
Bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew
And kept on moving along
The third strange town that I was in
Was settled peaceful and nice
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer
And to me it didn't seem right
So I washed my face in the morning dew
Bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew
And kept on moving along
Now someday times are bound to change
It can't be very far
And each injustice that I have seen
Will come before the bar
Then I'll wash my face in the morning dew
Bathe my soul in the sun
Wash my face in the morning dew
And my journey will be done"
"Lord take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark
Too dark to see
I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door
Chorus:
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Lord takes these guns away from me
Cause I can't shoot them anymore
A long black cloud is followin' me
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's
Repeat Chorus
Ooo ooo ooo Heaven Heaven
Ooo ooo ooo Heaven Heaven
Ooo ooo ooo Heaven Heaven
Ooo ooo ooo Heaven Heaven
Lord take this badge off of me
Cause I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark
Too dark to see
I feel like I'm knockin on heaven's door
Oooahhhhooo
Repeat Chorus"
"(Dolly Parton)
The hills were alive with wildflowers
And I was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run, they just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place
Just a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out
So I uprooted myself from my home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
So the garden, one day, set me free
I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Just a wild rambling rose, seeking mysteries untold
No regret for the path that I chose
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Wildflowers don't care where they grow"
"All your love lifting me higher
Than I ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
Then I'll be at your side forevermore
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
Now once I was downhearted
This little loneliness my foes and friend
But when you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
I'm so glad I finally found you
Yes that one in a million girl
And now with my loving arms around you
I can stand up and face the world
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher"
"I lie in bed beside you and watch you while you sleep
And wonder who I was before I loved you
Lying here beside you feeling so complete
Thinking how I love and need and trust you
Because I love you I'm a brand new person now because you love me
I can face the world and have the cause I love you
Because you love me because I love you
[ strings ]
Sweeter even still is knowing that you're lying there
And let you soon awake and reach to hold me
And anyway you want me that's the way that I am yours
Love as strong as this lets you control me
Because I love you...
Because I love you..."
"(Dolly Parton)
You make me act like a fool
You treat me mean and cold and cruel
You make me do things that I hate to do
Why do you make me act like a fool?
Now that you know just how much I care
You treat me mean and it ain't right nor fair
I keep holdin' on though I don't know what to
While you make me act like a fool
You know just how to hurt me and you often do
When we're out in publib I start fightin' with you
You start trouble in private when nobody knows
Oh, then you go away smellin' just like a rose
Though you make me act like a fool
You treat me mean cold and cruel
You make me do things that I hate to do
Oh, why must you make me act like a fool?
You know just how to hurt me as you often do
You start flirtin' in public with somebody new
You start trouble in private when nobody knows
Oh then you go away smellin' just like a rose
Though you make me act like a fool
You treat mean and cold and cruel
You make me do things that I hate to do
Oh but why do you make, oh why do I let you
Make me look like a fool?"
"When troubles surround us, when evils come
The body grows weak
The spirit grows numb
When these things beset us, God doesn't forget us
He sends us His love
On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove
When Jesus went down through the river that day
Well, he was baptized in the usual way
And when it was done
God blessed His son
He sent him His love
On the wings of a dove
On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove"
"(Dolly Parton)
Last night you called me Barbara
As you lay fast asleep
And although I'm not Barbara
You wanted me to be
You whispered words I haven't heard
In such a long, long time
Last night you said I love you
With Barbara on your mind
Sometimes I find traces of her kisses on your skin
And strands of chestnut hair
That say you've been with her again
Little traces of her that it breaks my heart to find
Last night you called me darlin'
With Barbara on your mind
With Barbara on your mind
You held me in your arms so tight
And lying there so close to you
I cried until day light"
"I lie in bed beside you and watch you while you sleep
And wonder who I was before I loved you
Lying here beside you feeling so complete
Thinking how I love and need and trust you
Because I love you I'm a brand new person now because you love me
I can face the world and have the cause I love you
Because you love me because I love you
[ strings ]
Sweeter even still is knowing that you're lying there
And let you soon awake and reach to hold me
And anyway you want me that's the way that I am yours
Love as strong as this lets you control me
Because I love you...
Because I love you..."
"No matter how you're tempted
Don't say yes to me
Don't make this night as smooth to lead me on
It's just that I'm so lonely and I need someone
I've been too lonely too long
Oh please be strong enough to refuse me
Before I let myself do something wrong
For down inside I'm not that kind of woman
I've been too lonely too long
Oh please don't take advantage of the situation
For I'm afraid that I'm too weak to resist temptation
When you're used to being loved
It's hard to live alone
I've been too lonely too long
I've been too lonely too long"
"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you,
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling ""Yoo hoo,""
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
Let's go, Let's look at the show,
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
It's grand, Just holding your hand,
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land.
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you."

Yes I see God where the mountains reach the sky
And I see God when the eagle starts to fly
I see God in a little baby's smile I see God and he makes my life worthwhile
Yes I see God when the bridegroom meets his bride
I see God in a father's loving eyes
I see God when a mother starts to cry I see God in a love that never dies
(I see God) where the people meet to pray (I see God) in the things they do and
say
(I see God) when the little children play
I see God and I know he's near all way
I see God yes I see God"
"LIFE RIDES THE TRAIN
WRITER PORTER WAGONER
Time waits for no one time never will
But moments of happiness can make time seem still
But time moves on swiftly passes life by while life rides the train time always flies
Life rides the train for some it moves slow
Some never find where their train of life will go
If it's bound to hell or to heaven on high
And while life rides the train time always flies
As life rides the train some get off the track
For one careless moment but never get back
Until it's much too late time has passed them by
So while life rides the train time always flies
Life rides the train..."

"Don't look at me with love in your eyes
Go look at somebody that can make it worthwhile
I'm hurt from a love affair I didn't want in
I'm in no condition to try to love again
Don't smile at me because it's no use
'Cause I don't have a smile that I can give to you
Someday, you might look me up, but let me be till then
For I'm in no condition to try to love again
I'm in no condition to try to love again
Man I love just broke my heart
And it must have time to mend
He have me the breeze
Now he's gone with the wind
I'm in no condition to try to love again
I'm in no condition to try to love again
Man I love just broke my heart
And it must have time to mend
He have me the breeze
Now he's gone with the wind
I'm in no condition to try to love again"
"I hoped I wouldn't miss you long
But I still can't believe you're gone
And I still miss you just as much as always
I hoped I'd get you off my mind
It's been a long time but I find
That I still think of you as much as always
As much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always
As much as always just as much as always
I still miss you, still think of you
Just as much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always
I still want you, still need you
Just as much as always
I hoped that I'd find someone else
But there's too much of you still left
And I still love you , just as much as always
I hoped that I'd forget your touch
But I still want it just as much
And I still need it just as much as always
As much as always, as much as always
Just as much as always
As much as always, just as much as always
I still miss you, still think of you
Just as much as always
As much as always, just as much as always
I still love you, oh I do love you
Just as much as always
As much as always, as much as always
I still love you, still want you, just as much as always
As much as always, just as much as always
I still need you still love you

"Here we sit lookin' at each other
Seems we're at a loss for what to say
Ties bind us both with someone else
We don't want to hurt but we must break away
And tonight I'll sit home a thinking
And tonight I'll sit home a drinking
We both live in separate homes where there's no love at all
Stayin' up late burning the midnight oil
[ fiddle - steel ]
Tomorrow we'll meet here in this same place
Where love and desire that just won't wait
In each others arms we'll dream for a little while
Then when it's time to leave it'll nearly drive us wild
And tonight again I'll sit home a thinking...
And tonight again I'll sit home a drinking
we both live in separate homes where there's no love at all
Stayin' up late burning the midnight oil
Stayin' up late burning the midnight oil"
"Happy, happy birthday baby
Although you're with somebody new
Thought I'd drop a line to say
That I wish this happy day
Would find me beside you
Happy, happy birthday baby
No, I can't call you my baby
Seems like years ago we met
On a day I can't forget
Cause that's when we fell in love
Do you remember
The names we had for each other
I was your pretty
You were my baby
Oh, how could we say goodbye
Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I'm not acting like a lady
So I'll close this note to you
With good luck and wishes too
Happy happy birthday baby"
"(Dolly Parton)
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All ye maidens hede my warning
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
They will vow to always love you
Swear no love but yours will do
Then they'll leave you for another
Break your little heart in two
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
If I were a little sparrow
O'er these mountains I would fly
I would find him,yes I would find him
Look into his lying eyes
I would flutter all around him
On my little sparrow wings
I would ask him, yes I would ask him
Why he let me love in vain
I am not a little sparrow
I am just the broken dream
Of a cold false-hearted lover
And his evil cunning scheme
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All ye maidens fair and tender
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Oh the sorrow never ends"
"Oh I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyes
Who is sailing all over the sea
And I'm thinking tonight of him only
And I wonder does he ever think of me
Could been better for us both had we never
In this wide wicked world had never met
For the pain and the pleasures he's brought me
I am sure I will never forget
So I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyes...
Oh you told me once dear that you love me
And you swore that we never would part
But a linking the chain has been broken
Leaving me with a sad broken heart"
"Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you
But I hope it ain't for long
And I wonder if you're even gonna notice that I'm gone
Oh it hurts to know you cheated
And it hurt to know you lied
But it hurts me even worse to know you never even tried
I packed my suitcase full of heartaches
Headin' for the train depot
And I bought a one-way ticket
On that train they call Blue Smoke
I left the station straight-up midnight
Feelin' lonely, lost and blue
In a trail of blue smoke with my heart broke
Said good-bye to you
Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Oh, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through"
"Hmm (oh ain't he cute)
Ah well I don't like to get up if I feel like sleeping
No and I don't like to sweep my floor if I don't feel like sweeping
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
I've been this way too long and you can't ever change me now
Don't waste your time in tryin' cause I am just what I am
I've got my way of doin' things and who can say I'm wrong
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
Oh and I don't like to make my bed if I don't feel like makin' it
No and I don't like to bake no bread if I don't feel like bakin' it
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
Cause you can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
Well I don't like to hoe no corn if I don't feel like hoein' it
(You should you're corny)
And I don't like to mow no grass if I don't feel like mowin' it
(I know it's comin' through the upstairs window)
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
If you don't like the way I am...
Oh as far as I can remember back you have been this way
(And as long as you remember I will be honey)
When you was in the first grade you was exact the same way
(First grade I was waitin' for the second)
You swiped the pencils and scattered paper all over the desk
(Oh that's real cute you're makin' up stuff)"
"So I feel so blue sometimes I want to die and so I've got a broken heart so what
They say that time will heal all wounds in mice and men
And I know that someday I'll forget and love again
But just between you and me I've got my doubts about it
Just between you and me you're too much to forget
So I've lost the only one I've ever loved and so I've never felt so low so what
I'll just tell myself each time I want to cry
That someday time will dry the teardrops from my eyes
Just between you and me I'm not so sure about it
Just between you and me you're too much to forget
You're too much to forget"
"To be with you is what I want more than anything
But I must share my life with the one who wears my ring
And there are tiny places I look into each night
I love you but my hands are tied
I know how much they need you and dear I understand
I know you'll never leave them cause you're not that kind of man
But I can't control my feelings though heaven knows I tried
And I love you but my hands are tied
My hands are tied and I can't break the ties that bind
I love you more than life but you never will be mine
I know how much you want me I can see it in your eyes
And I love you but my hands are tied
[ steel ]
My hands are tied and I can't break the ties that bind...
Yes I love you but my hands are tied"

In the meantime troubles gonna show us
In the meantime the sky is still above us
In the meantime you know God's gonna love us
In the meantime, in the meantime, in the meantime"
"(Dolly Parton)
The hills were alive with wildflowers
And I was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run, they just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place
Just a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out
So I uprooted myself from my home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
So the garden, one day, set me free
I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Just a wild rambling rose, seeking mysteries untold
No regret for the path that I chose
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Wildflowers don't care where they grow"
"Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
In your cowboy boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here looking like that
Here comes my baby
Draggin' my heart behind
He's drivin' me crazy
Who says love is blind
He's got a wanderin' eye and a travelin' mind
Big ideas and a little behind
Out with a different woman every night
But I remember when he was mine
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
In your high heeled boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Waltzing right in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
When you could stop traffic in a gunney sack
Why you're almost givin' me a heart attack
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that
I just can't stand it
To see him on the town
He's out slow dancing
With every girl around
I'm a softhearted woman he's a hardheaded man
And he's gonna make me feel just as bad as he can
He's got himself a mean streak a half a mile wide
But now he's dancing on this heart of mine
Ooh, Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
In your high heeled boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why's you come in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
In your high heeled boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
When you could stop traffic in a gunney sack
Why you're almost givin' me a heart attack
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that"
"(Dell McCoury)
Though the miles are between us
I thought our love would strengthen
As it has so many times before
But something has happened
I can see it in your eyes
I can feel my world is crumblin'
And the blues are at my door
The last letter that you wrote was
On a blue piece of paper
That old feelin's back
The clouds are movin' in
The beginning of the end is near
I feel your love has faded into darkness
It seems I have no friend
I feel the blues movin' in
Oh it's not the words you wrote that made me sad
And broken-hearted
That's put me in this sad shape I'm in
Between the lines are mixed emotions
And there's teardrops on the paper
You said that's all I'll write today
I'll cose for now old friend
The last letter that you wrote was
On a blue piece of paper
That old feelin's back
The clouds are movin' in
My state of mind is desperate
And this hole that I'm sinkin' in
Gets deeper while I'm diggin' to get out
Oh please give the right answer to the questions I'm askin'
Tell me you still love me
That would turn my world about
The last letter that you wrote was
On a blue piece of paper
That old feelin's back
The clouds are movin' in"
"(Bob Tubert & Demetrius Tapp)
Folks back home think I'm a star now when they hear my records play
They say there home town girl made good and she'd go a long long way
Mom wonders why I don't drive back in that big fine car I own
The truth is I don't have a car and I'm ashamed to go back home
A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick
A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit
These are all my possessions all I have to my name
And a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame
I'm so glad that dad can't see me now, his favorite little girl
Singing in this dingy place on the wrong side of the world
And I'm glad that I can't see the boy that offered me his name
For I was blind and turned from him in this empty search for fame
A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick
A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit
These are all of my possessions, all I have to my name
And a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame"
"Writer Dolly Parton
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I love you, I do, but I can't be true
Men are my weakness I've got a roving eye
And I've fallen victim to many a smile
I just love the excitement of love when it's new
I'm just a hopeless romantic so I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true
Some play it safe while some like it hot
I guess you could say I never knew when to stop
But when I'm lovin' you, I'll give it all that I got
It might be different with you to know I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules
Now that you know it's true, I'll leave the rest up to you
I'll be good to you, but I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, its not a weakness in you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I really love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules
Now that you know it's true, I'll leave the rest up to you
I'll be good to you, but I can't be true, I can't be true"
"I've been down on my luck,
I've been shadowed with trouble and sorrow.
But I ain't givin' up'
'Cause I know there is always tomorrow.
There are no guarantees,
Life is always a hit or miss.
But I truly believe
I won't always be feeling' like this.
I'm gonna shine like the sun
When these clouds roll away from my door.
When it's all said and done
I won't be at your mercy no more.
I will prove my own worth,
Heal the damage and hurt that's been done.
And when the cryin's all done.
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
I've been thinking here lately
What all I can do to improve.
Though I've suffered greatly,
I know just what I have to do.
I have to move forward,
Cut losses, break loose and move on.
And I have to swim shoreward
Lest I should drown out here alone.
I'm gonna shine like the sun
When these clouds roll away from my door.
I won't crawl I can run
I'll be at no ones mercy no more.
I'll be swinging on sunbeams
So proud that I finally won.
And when the losin's all done.
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna shine.
I'm gonna shine like the sun.
When these clouds roll away from my door.
And when it's all said and done
I won't be at your mercy no more.
I'll be off chasin' rainbows,
Rejoicin' and havin' my fun.
And when the cryin's all done,
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
When the cryin's all done,
When the tryin's all done,
When the lyin's all done
There'll be nothin' but sun.
When it's all said and done
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun, shine like the sun."
"You jark back your hand away from mine
And I move my lips away from yours
Then quietly we sit trying to forget
Those deep running thoughts that run wild across our minds
You quickly stop the words you start to say
And we realize just how close we are
And we both know if we let ourselves go
We'll do something we'll be sorry for
Slip away today means sorrow tomorrow
It's love we know but we can't keep but yet we like to borrow
Trying to hold back emotions and desires
It's hard to keep from doing something we'll be sorry for
[ ac.guitar ]
My love hungry heart begs for more
Of what your lips hold in store
But our conscience just won't let us at least tonight it kept us
From jumping off the deep end and going too far
But one of these nights you and I
Will be ruled by the passion of our hearts
And we both know that we let ourselves go
And do something that we'll be sorry for"
"(Dolly Parton/Larry Weiss)
Can't say we're lovers, can't say we're friends
Don't even know if I'll see you again
But against your warm body I felt so alive
And you got me over a heartache tonight
My heart was broken, my hurt was deep
I had lost something I wanted to keep
Lookin' for comfort when you caught my eye
And you got me over a heartache tonight
Sweet conversation, a drink and a dance
Led to an evening of making romance
And I don't even care if it's wrong or it's right
'Cause you got me over a heartache tonight"
"I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
And when it's cold outside,
Well I've got the month of May
I guess you say
What could make me feel this way
My love, my love, my love,
Talking bout my love, my love
I've got so much honey
You know the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Oh than the birds in trees
Oh and I know, I know,
I know what you're gonna say
What what could make me feel this way
My love, my love, my love,
Talkin' about my love, my love"
"(Dolly Parton)
Hello, I don't know me from Adam, you don't know me from Eve
I just came here tonight 'cause I was lonely
You're no Elvis Presley, I'm no Marilyn Monroe
But I do think you're sexy, just thought I'd tell you so
Hey could I have your autograph
Your name and your number on a small photograph
I'd like to know you and what you're all about
Hey could I have your autograph
I've had my eyes on you and you're worth lookin' at
Could I ask you out or should a lady do that
You may not be famous but you look like a star
You should be in movies as cute as you are
Hey could I have your autograph
Your name and your number on a small photograph
Could I interest you in a romance perhaps
Hey could I have your autograph
Got my heart in my hands and my head in the clouds
And you're everything every girl dreams about
And being with you would be heaven no doubt
What I wouldn't do for your autograph
Oh could I have your autograph
Oh could I have your autograph
Hey could I have your autograph
I like your body could I help you work it out
Maybe moving to the music playing on the phonograph
Hey could I have your autograph
Oh could I have your autograph
You know you're just the kind to makes a woman real proud
Would you take a chance on a girl from the South
Could I have your autograph"
"I'm comin' home, I've done my time
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine
If you received my letter telling you, I'd soon be free
Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me, if you still want me
Whoa, tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
It's been three long years, do you still want me?
If I don't see a ribbon 'round the old oak tree
I'll stay on the bus forget about us, put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
Bus driver, please look for me
'Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see
I'm really still in prison and my love, she holds the key
A simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free
I wrote and told her please
Whoa, tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
It's been three long years, do you still want me?
If I don't see a ribbon 'round the old oak tree
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us, put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree"
"Just a few old memories
Slipped in through my door
Though I thought I had closed it
So tightly before
I can't understand it
Why it should bother my mind
For it all belongs to another place and time
Just a few old keep-sakes
Way back on the shelf
No, they don't mean nothin'
Well I'm surprised they're still left
Just a few old love letters
With the edges all brown
And an old faded picture
I keep turned upside-down
Just a few old memories
Going way back in time
Well I can hardly remember
I don't know why I'm cryin'
I can't understand it
Well I'm surprised myself
First thing tomorrow morning
I'll clean off that shelf
Just a few old keep-sakes
Way back on the shelf
No, they don't mean nothin'
Well I'm surprised that they're left
Just a few old love letters
With their edges all brown
And an old faded picture
I keep turned upside-down"
"(Dolly Parton)
Whenever forever comes, when darkness shall hide the sun
I'll still be shining with love for you
When glory bells chime, my love will ring true
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my love will be yours always
Whenever forever comes, when all things are said and done
I'll still be feeling the same way I do
I'll be there for you and still wanting you
God gave you to me, and me to you
And you will still be the one whenever forever comes
We'll float on a cloud through eternity
You'll gather the stars, you'll give them to me
I'll give you the moon and we'll replace the sun
Whenever forever comes, whenever forever comes
What would I have ever done had I not had you to love?
You've given me more than I ever dreamed
Loving you more every day, so it seems
Greater than all other loves I have seen
Its essence will linger on whenever forever comes
We'll float on a cloud through eternity
You'll gather the stars, you'll give them to me
I'll give you the moon and we'll replace the sun
Whenever forever comes, whenever forever comes"
"Hmm (oh ain't he cute)
Ah well I don't like to get up if I feel like sleeping
No and I don't like to sweep my floor if I don't feel like sweeping
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
I've been this way too long and you can't ever change me now
Don't waste your time in tryin' cause I am just what I am
I've got my way of doin' things and who can say I'm wrong
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
Oh and I don't like to make my bed if I don't feel like makin' it
No and I don't like to bake no bread if I don't feel like bakin' it
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
Cause you can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
Well I don't like to hoe no corn if I don't feel like hoein' it
(You should you're corny)
And I don't like to mow no grass if I don't feel like mowin' it
(I know it's comin' through the upstairs window)
If you don't like the way I am then you can move along
You can't change the way I am I've been this way too long
If you don't like the way I am...
Oh as far as I can remember back you have been this way
(And as long as you remember I will be honey)
When you was in the first grade you was exact the same way
(First grade I was waitin' for the second)
You swiped the pencils and scattered paper all over the desk
(Oh that's real cute you're makin' up stuff)"
"Friends ask how I'll get along without you they say it's so sad we're apart
I have to agree that I don't seem like me I'm havin' a ball with my heart
Anything's better than nothing nothing's not too much to lose
Anything's better than nothing nothing's what I have with you
I've got to admit that it hurts me I don't like to fight or to fuss
But now you and me are just happy we're free and everyone's crying but us
Anything's better than nothing...
It really must be disappointment to see love and dream turn to smoke
I can't blame my friends when their teardrops begin
I once thought that love made a home
Anything's better than nothing...
Nothing's what I have with you..."
"Like the weather your heart changes with each season
Springtime summer fall and winter too
Though I know I'll never understand the reason
I still wonder why each season changes you
It was springtime when I found you like the flowers
And our love grew warmer with the summer sun
In the fall I could see our love was changing
It broke my heart to see what wintertime had done
Like the weather your heart changes...
[Trumpet]
Came the spring again you said that you were sorry
And the summer brought a golden memory
In the fall I saw your love was changing
And the winter brought the same old misery
Like the weather your heart changes..."
"THE LORD ID MY SHEPHERED , THE LORD IS MY SHEPHED

AND I SHALL NOT DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER"
"I got in a little trouble at the county seat
Lord, they put me in the jailhouse
For loafing on the street
Well, the judge said guilty
He made his point
He said forty-five dollars
Or thirty days in the joint
That'll be cash on the barrelhead, hun
You can take your choice
You're twenty-one
No money down
No credit plan
No time to chase you
'Cause I'm a busy man
I found a telephone number on a laundry slip
I had a good, hardy jailor
With a six gun hip
He let me call long distance
She said, ""Number, please""
And just as soon as I told her
She shouted back at me
Said that'll be cash on the barrelhead, hun
Not part, not half
But the entire sum
No money down
No credit line
'Cause a little boy tells me
You're the travelin' kind
Thirty days in the jailhouse
Four days on the road
I was feelin' mighty hungry
My feet, a heavy load
I saw a Greyhound comin'
Stuck out my thumb
As soon as I was seated
The driver caught my arm
Said that'll be cash on the barrelhead, hun
This old, grey dog gets paid to run
When the engine starts
And the wheels will roll
Give me cash on the barrelhead
I take ya down the road
Ohh, cash on the barrelhead
I take you down the road"
"Nobody believes that I really care for you
They don't think my heart is true
I don't think you agree
You know I'm a lifetime gaurantee
So if they ask you what you mean to me
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Go on and tell 'em baby
Nobody believes we got somethin' they ain't got
They've never seen a fire this hot
They never got that far
We're burning as bright as any star
So if they ask you what your feelings are
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We've got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Go ahead and tell 'em baby
Feels so good, holding tight
Loving you through the night
Oh and they can call it what they like
But they ain't got it right
No, no, no
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We've got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything
Oooo...
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Oh, oh, oh
Don't call it love

We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough"

If you hear me crying in the night
Pretend that you don't hear me it's alright
Don't ask me why I'm crying, please don't make a sound
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
And if you think I act a little strange
And you don't understand when I do things
Like running through the fields while the rain is pouring down
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
And even though you may not understand me
I hope that you'll accept me like I am
For there are many sides of me, my mind and spirit must be free
And I might smile when other folks would frown
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
I might go out chasing butterflies
And if I fail to catch one I might cry
And if you want me you might find me in the meadow walking 'round
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
I might be home and busy cleaning house
And in the middle of my work I might go out
And go play games with children at the playground
It makes me happy, and that's just the way I am
And even though you may not understand me
I hope that you'll accept me like I am
For there are childish sides of me
My mind and spirit must be free
I might smile when you think I should frown
I don't know why, it's just the way I am"
"Well I've sacrificed time with family and friends, gave up vacations for work without end, 24/7/365 but I was willing to make the sacrifice but empty or full, I've carried my pail, you don't drink the water if you don't dig the well, through blood, sweat and tears I have built a good life but it didn't come without sacrifice
And I was gonna be rich no matter how much it cost, and I was gonna win no matter how much I lost all through the years I've kept my eye on the prize, you ask if it's worth the sacrifice, the sacrifice."
"Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
I'll always dream, still I'll never own you
Making believe, its all I can do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe that I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe
Making believe that I never lost you
But my happy hours are fun and so few
My plans for the future will never come true
Making believe what else can I do
Can't hold you close when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe that I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe"
"The fisherman are pitching pennies in the sand beside the sea
And the sunrise hits their oilskin boots, their painted boats and me
And they seem to know the ocean like a man knows a woman
She makes him wait around for half the morning for the tide to turn
[Chorus]
Pull on the ropes, seine haul fisherman
Never catches more than he knows he can sell in a day
Pull in the nets, seine haul fisherman
Day's for work, night's the time to go dancing
They're drinking beer and laughing and squinting at the sun
Waiting for the gulls to tell them when the fish will come
Their faces brown and weathered from all the nets they've run
They've learned to wait, they always know that the tide will turn
[Chorus]
Now way out on the ocean the big ships hunt for whales
And the Japanese have caught so many now they hunt for snails
But my fisherman's not greedy he seems content to live
With the sun and the sand and a net full of fishes when the tide turns
[Chorus]
Oh, yes pull on the ropes, seine haul fisherman
Never catches more than he knows he can sell in a day
Oh, and pull in the nets, seine haul fisherman
Day's for work, night's the time to go dancing"
"Here you come again
Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger
Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you.
All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again and here I go
All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there got all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again, and here I go, here I go
And here I go
And here I go
Here you come again and here I go
Here I go"
"Satan's got river Satan's got river deep and wide so deep and wide
Satan's got a river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming he's got folks a swimming
In the warm smooth tire
But some day Satan's river
Yes some day Satan's river is gonna run dry it's gonna run dry
What was once a smooth river hot lava will make the tide
Stay clear of Satan's river heaven's on either side
Big yachts are sailing Satan's river so smooth
Never stopping or thinking about God's golden rule
When the river starts to sinking they'll cry I've been a fool
Satan's got river deep and wide
Satan's got river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming in the warm smooth tide"
"Loving you isn't good for me you keep my tears flowing
If I loved you I couldn't stay gone so there's no use in going
Loving you is a habit I can't break
I haven't found a way yet but I've been tryin'
To stop loving you but I can't wait there's no use a lyin'
Loving you is a habit I can't break
Loving you is a habit I can't break
I've been loving you much too long now to change the way I feel
So I might as well get used to these heartaches

Don't ask me if I'm crying
Can't you see it ain't raining
No, this ain't sand in my eyes
Before it has been spoken
When one good heart gets broken
That's enough to make a cowgirl cry
Cause here I am, all by myself
My man he just up and left
He said he would never try again
Now the thing that hurts me most
When he makes up his mind to go
He'll be gone, like a wild texas wind
Chorus:
Like a wild texas wind
Oh my man is gone again
I feel lonesome settin' in
Like a wild texas wind
Like a Wild Texas Wind
Oh my man is gone, he's gone, he's gone again
I feel lonesome sittin' in
Like a wild texas wind
Hmmmm"

Even though there's no reason to doubt
This can never be
You keep saying it's wrong
Neither one of us is free
Still I want to hold on
When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
Even a fool would let go
Love has no reason
Like the words in a song that don't rhyme
My love has no season
I just know that it's there all the time
Maybe just you and me
I can't believe that it's wrong
Thinking about you and me
Just makes me want to hold on
When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
Even a fool would let go"
"AFRAID TO LIVE AND AFRAID OF DYING
WITH PORTER WAGONER
WRITER PORTER WAGONER
They say most anything you eat could hurt your health
Be careful what you drink, don't harm yourself
And pollution in the air might make you sick
Makes you afraid to live, afraid that you might die too quick
Do the men that quote this danger really know
Life is gift to be enjoyed and not to worry so
The biggest danger sign that we should know
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go
We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'
And afraid to love the one we love, afraid they might be lyin'
We can't enjoy life when they say each thing might bring an early grave
We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'
Do the men that quote this danger really know?
Life is gift to be enjoyed, why worry so?
The biggest danger sign that we should know
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go"
"I found out the hard way
And I'm never gonna break your heart
I know, too late
And I don't wanna break your heart
Guess I had to go away just to find
What I left behind
You're the only one
You're the only one
Take me back
To where we started from
And let's make it now
Like we made it then
This ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again
Nights I lay in bed
And your covers wouldn't warm my feet
And morning found me
Bitter or a bit too sweet
Oh baby, I had to go away
Just to run back and say
You're the only one
You're the only one
Take me back
To where we started from
Can we make it now
Like we made it then
This ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again
You're the only one darlin'
They'll never be anyone else but you
I love you so much
You are my love, you've become my life
And I never meant to break your heart
But, sometimes, you just got to go away
To find what you left behind
You're the only one
You're the only one
Take me back
To where we started from
Can we make it now
Like we made it then
This ol' heart ain't gonna break your heart again
You're the only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
The only one
So take me back
To where we started from
You're the only one
The only one
You're the only one
You're the only one
The only one
Take me back
To where we started from"
"Soft as the voice of an angel, breathing a lesson unheard
Hope with a gentle persuasion whispers her comforting word
Wait till the darkness is over, wait till the tempest is gone
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow, after the shower is gone
Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice
Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice"
"(Dolly Parton)
Stay out of my bedroom
Don't be messin' up my pillows and sheets
With your powder and perfume
If you don't have some understanding of me
Don't be kncokin' on my door
I don't want you to play in my fantasies
Stay out of my bedroom
Baby, if you can't take the heat
If you want it, come and get it, baby
Satisfaction guaranteed
I'm a pleaser, free and eager
I ain't never had as much fun as I need
Easy lovin', that's down my alley
I may be easy but, at least I'm cheap
Stay out of my bedroom, baby
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Stay out of
Stay out of
You're dealin' with some hot stuff
Baby, can you deal with the heat?
We might burn on forever, we might burn on tonight
Where there's smoke there is fire from the flames that I ignite
The heat is intense when the fire's blazin' high
Slavin' over all those red hot lovers at night
If you come to my bedroom the heart of the heat
I will pleasure your body in sheer ecstasy
I will touch you in places no one else ever reached
Till you won't remember anybody else but me
If you want it come and get it
If it burns you don't come cryin' to me
Don't come knockin' on my door
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Don't be peepin' through my window
If you don't appreciate what you see
Stay out of my bedroom, baby
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Stay out of, stay out of
You're dealin' with some hot stuff
Baby, can you deal with the heat?
Stay out of my bedroom...
If you can't take it, stay out of my bedroom"
"I want to tell you all a story 'bout a harper valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter that attended harper valley junior high
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said, ""mama, i've got a note here from the harper valley pta""
Well the note says ""mrs. johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
Now we don't believe you ought to be a bringin' up your little girl this way""
And it was signed by the secretary, harper valley pta
Well it happened that the pta was gonna meet that very afternoon
And boy, were they surprised as mrs. johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard i can still recall the word she had to say
She said ""i'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley pta
Now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
And mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And mr. baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down
Now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's bar again
And if you smell shirley thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think that i ain't fit
Well this is just a little payton place and you're all harper valley hypocrites"
"I used to think maybe you loved me now baby I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door

"Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me!
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss-man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
An' the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5, whoa what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5, working 9 to 5"

Oh look at you boy, look at them jeans
Cutest little buttfull I've ever seen
I'd like to find you under my tree
Whatcha tryin' to do to me, huh?
Hey look at them boots, look at that hat
You can get in big trouble lookin' like that
Flirtin' like mad, talkin' that trash
You could make a good girl go bad real fast
Chorus:
Whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do anyhow
I ain't made of steel but if looks could kill
Well I'd 've been dead by now
Tell me whatcha tryin to do to me
Look at that smile, look at them eyes
All lit up like Christmas lights
When you land on my roof tonight
Well here's what you better be
Well you'd better be fit, you'd better be prime
Cause I'm gonna ring your Christmas chime
When you climb down my chimney
Do whatcha you know only you can do to me
Repeat Chorus
I said ooh, what a thrill but if looks could kill
Well I'd 've been dead by now
Tell me whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do to me"

"I was so excited when you asked if I could go
But mom said I'd have to ask my daddy
I met him at the front door so afraid that he'd say no
But he smiled and said, ""Let mama get you ready.""
In your cotton shirt and faded jeans, you came for me
And the gingham dress was all I had to wear
With a dollar in your pocket and a borrowed car
You picked a yellow daisy for my hair
That's the way it could have been
Oh, that's the way it should have been
If I had met you way back then
That's the way it would have been
I put away my gingham for a pretty dress of white
And you wore a suit instead of faded jeans
Our wedding day was perfect and we loved away the night
Life for us was filled with lots of dreams
We bought a house upon a hill outside of town
And two young people finally settled in
And you just won't believe the little children running 'round
And they pick yellow daisies now and then
And that's the way it could have been
Oh, that's the way it should have been
If I had met you way back then
That's the way it would have been
That's the way it could have been"

Some men find her sexy, some men disagree
But if she's not, it's not because she doesn't want to be
She wears a push-up bra from Freddericks, five inch high heel shoes
Maybelline and Rubinstein, and Avon's best perfume
She's a working girl
She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl
Some find her to aggressive, she don't know how to stop
Cause she's the kind that don't look down until it's from the top
She's elegant and stylish, French perfume and a fur
Designer clothes by Halston and Diane Von Furstenburg
And she's a working girl
She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl
She has taken her place among the tallest of trees
But she weeps like a willow when she's brought to her knees
Cause she's a working girl
You'll find her dressed according to standard uniform
Cause she must dress in comfort for the job she must perform
She has so many faces, she wears so many names
She goes so many places and she does so many things
Cause she's a working girl
She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl
She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl
She's a working girl, she is single and free
She's a mother and wife and she's proud to be
A working girl"
"I'm to the point where it don't add up
I can't say I've come this far
With my guitar on pure dumb luck
That's not to say, I know it all
'Cause every time I get too high up
On my horse I fall
'Cause I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I need, Jesus & gravity
But I'm as bad as anyone
Takin' all these blessings in my life
For granted one by one
When I start to think and it's all me
Well, something comes along
And knocks me right back on my knees and
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I need, Jesus & gravity
He's my friend, He's my light
He's my wings, He's my flight
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I'm gonna need
I've got Jesus, I got Jesus
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I'll ever need
'Cause I've got Jesus & gravity
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I need
'Cause I've got Jesus & gravity
Jesus, I got Jesus, I've got Jesus
He's my only friend
He lifts me up, He give me wings
He gives me hope
And He gives me strength
And that's all I'll ever need
As long as He keeps lifting me
He is my light, He is my guide
He is my wings, He is my flight
Lift me, I've got Jesus
I've got Jesus and that's all I need"
"Nobody believes that I really care for you
They don't think my heart is true

So if they ask you what you mean to me
Don't call it love

We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Go on and tell 'em baby
Nobody believes we got somethin' they ain't got
They've never seen a fire this hot
They never got that far
We're burning as bright as any star
So if they ask you what your feelings are
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We've got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Go ahead and tell 'em baby
Feels so good, holding tight
Loving you through the night
Oh and they can call it what they like
But they ain't got it right
No, no, no
Don't call it love

We've got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything
Oooo...
Don't call it love

"I can live in a mansion or a double-wide
Eat sushi raw or my catfish fried
Wherever I am, then that's where I belong
'Cause I'm quite content with who I am
And if you ain't, well, kiss my ham
Country is as country does and I'm country to the bone
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I always will be, that's for sure
Country born and country bred
Countrified and country-fed
A country heart and a country head
'Cause I'm country to the core
Now, I can drive a tractor or a Cadillac
I can fly first class or slum in the back
But I'll be the same ol' gal when I arrive
Oh I can wear denim or I can wear silk
Drink champagne or chocolate milk
Take the best or live with less, 'cause a country girl survives
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
And the way I'll be until they lay me low
Country born and country bred
I'm countrified and I'm country-fed
And I'll be that way 'til I'm country dead
'Cause I'm country head to toe
And what you see is what you get
Nothing's ever changed me yet
Nothing will, it's a pretty safe bet
'Cause I'm country through and through
Oh, that's country!
Country is as country does
It's the way I am and it's the way I was
It's the way I'll be until my dying day
I'm country born and country bred
Countrified and country-fed
And nothing done and nothing said can change my country ways
Nothing done and nothing said
Nothing's gonna change my country ways
I don't think so
Wouldn't change if I could
Country is as country does
It's the way I is and it's the way I was
Country born and country bred
I'm countrified and I'm country-fed, you know that
I'm country (she's country)
But now that don't mean I can't go to town!"

I give an inch and you take a mile and you tell me to jump and I just ask how
high
I've been over backwards to show you I care
And someone must always give more than their share
I say I'm sorry when the fault is not mine
And I take the blame for our fights all the time
I love you so much and it doesnt seem fair
That someone must always give more than their share
I know you well enough to know you would never admit you were wrong
And you know me well enough to know I give in cause my love is so strong
If I give an inch and you take a mile if you tell me to jump well I just ask
how high
I've been over backwards to show you I care
Cause someone must always give more than their share
Yes someone must always give more than their share"

When your eyes meet mine my heart beats out of time
And I burn with desire through and through
I can't help myself I can't see no one else cause my eyes can only see you
My eyes can only see you my eyes can only see you
Your face is always in view for my eyes can only see you
I want you so much and I long for your touch and your eyes tell me you want me
too
Oh it may not be right but I'm too weak to fight and my eyes can only see you
My eyes can only see you...
And my eyes can only see you"

Blue me, blue me
Blue is the color
That fits best on me
I'm blue
Just as blue as can be
Blue me, Blue me
I cry
And I die
I lie awake at night
And I question why
Must it be
I can never be free
Blue me, Blue me
My heart is heavy
But it's empty inside
No one to love me
Or to lay down beside
I'm blue
The queen of sorrow
Wears royal blue
My luck ain't changin'
Is it ever goin' to
I'm blue, Oh I'm blue
Why must I wear this robe of blue misery
Blue me, Blue me
Ooh
This sad old feeling
Is breakin' me down
No satisfaction with these blues hangin' 'round
Lord, I'm blue
Oh, I'm so blue Why can't I shake it tell me where will this end
When will I get out of this blue rut I'm in
Oh, I'm blue
Looks like the blues just took a liking to me
Blue me, Blue me Blue me, Blue me
Blue is the color that fits best on me
Ooooh, I'm blue
I'm just as blue as can be
Blue me

When you need to be love, let me love you
When you need a friend, reach out to me
When you need reassuring that it's alright
Anything you need, that what I'll be
For I want to be the one you always come to
When you find you need a place to go
Let mine be the hand you always cling to
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
I can be the one that makes you happy
I'll be your umbrella when it rains
I will be someone that you can count on
In other words, I'll be your everything
For I want to be the one you always come to
When you find you need a place to go
Let mine be the hand you always cling to
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold
Mine will be the only hand you ever need to hold"

Love's a war we all survive, a never ending compromise
We always seem to say we're through, just to say tomorrow
Babe, I'm still in love with you
Every now and then we fight
So very sure we're both right
Saying things we never mean
Just to take them back tomorrow
And admit how wrong we've been
We're through forever 'til tomorrow
That's all we really seem to say
We can't go on with all this sorrow
We've got to find a better way
Many times we would fight and I would leave you
Then I'd find, just how much I really need you, and love you
Oh, oh, candle light, a glass of wine
Can bring back vision to the blind
Making love is sweet revenge
And when the battle's over
We're back in love, and we both win"

Packin' my suitcase writin' a tear stained good-bye note
Sayin' so long to a love gone wrong and that's all she wrote
Leavin' behind what once was mine with sad regrets
But it's all gone now and I'm leavin' town on the Heartbreak Express
Walkin in the rain with a heart full of pain to the train depot
The only things that's gonna keep me warm now is my overcoat
Lost and lonely waitin in line at the ticket desk
Hey mister won't you give me a one-way ticket on the Heartbreak Express
I'm gonna roll on down the line
I'm gonna go so far I'm gonna get it off my mind
It hurts to know it ain't enough when you give your best
Got a ticket to ride and I'm leavin tonight on the Heartbreak Express
Oh I couldn't hold a candle to a flaming beauty that caught his eye
It's killin' me now but I won't stay around and let him watch me die
Oh it just goes to show you never do know 'cause I never would'a guessed
I'd be sittin' here now on a train sorrow bound called the Heartbreak Express
I'm gonna roll on down the line
I'm gonna go so far I'm gonna get it off mt mind
Maybe someday somewhere someway I will forget
But there's no goin' back so roll down the track you ole Heartbreak Express
Feelin' alone while a low whistle moans
On the Heartbreak Express"

"When I look out over a green field of clover
Or watch the sun set at the end of the day
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty
And everything's beautiful in its own way
When I see a fountain flow from a mountain
Or see April showers bring flowers to May
I can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder
And everything's beautiful in its own way
Words can't describe what I feel inside
When I see the beauty in each coming day
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
And everything's beautiful in its own way
When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger
The storm's even beautiful in its own way
When I see leaves drop off from the treetop
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder
God made all things beautiful in their own way"
"(Porter Wagoner)
Your love's as fresh in my memory as this morning's sunrise
And still just as beautiful to me
I can still feel the soft touch of love sweet and tender
You give me love to remember
Nights with no ending, filled with love I'm remembering
Each night that I spend with you
I can still feel your soft touch, I can still feel your warm love
You give me love to remember
And each morning when I wake up
Before I leave my pillow. I search through my dreams carefully
Just to make sure that I don't leave one tiny memory
'Cause I dream of the love I remember
Nights with no ending, filled with love I'm remembering
Each night that I spend with you
I can still feel your warm love, I can still feel your soft touch
You give me love to remember
Love to remember"
"(Dolly Parton)
You say that you're bored with life and that you're bored with me
'Cause you say that this love of ours ain't what it ought to be
Now you despise this little house that we've always called home
I know that you don't love me now, but you'll love me when I'm gone
Gone
You'll love me when I'm gone and then you'll realize just what I meant to you
You-oo-oo-oo
You'll miss me when I'm gone and then you'll realize how good I've been to you
You-ooo-ooo-ooo
You'll want me when I'm gone and then you'll realize you've loved me all along
Oh, it's true you may not love me now, but you'll love me when I'm gone
Gone
We've grown too familiar with each other, so you say
You say there's no excitement now. Too bad you feel that way
Well, I wonder how exciting that your life will be alone
Oh, I know you may not want me now, but you'll miss me when I'm gone
Gone
You'll love me when I'm gone and then you'll realize just what I meant to you
You-oo-oo-oo
You'll miss me when I'm gone and then you'll realize how good I've been to you
You-ooo-ooo-ooo
You'll want me when I'm gone and then you'll realize you've loved me all along
Oh, I know you may not want me now, but you'll miss me when I'm gone
Gone"
"Well, I met an old man walkin' down the street
His clothes were torn and tattered
With sandals on his feet
And I stopped to help him
And lend him a hand
He said, I love you so much
But you must understand
Silver and gold might buy you a home
But things of this world
They won't last you long
And time has a way of turning us old
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold
And he said to me, let's rest for awhile
For I have some good news to share with you, child
He said, you can't change this old world
The people need to know
That a dear savior died here
A long, long time ago
Silver and gold might buy you a home
But things of this world
They won't last you long
And time has a way of turning us old
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold
His eyes shown like diamonds
And his smile was heaven sent
His hair was long and flowing
And his back was slightly bent
And I knew he knew it
For that day I changed
As I watched him walk on
I forgot to get his name
He said, silver and gold can't buy you a home
When this life has ended
And your time is gone
But you can live in a world where
You'll never grow old
And things can't be bought there with silver and gold
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold"
"How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
Yes, and how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till we know
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
It's blowin' in the wind
Blowin', blowin' in the wind
How many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Blowin', blowin' in the wind
Blowin', it's blowin' in the wind
Blowin', it's blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind"
"Now, people say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I'll tell a joke or two.
Although I might be laughin' loud and hearty,
Deep down inside I'm blue.
[Chorus]
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place.
If you'll look closer,
It's easy to trace the tracks of my tears.
I need you, need you.
But since you left me if you see me with another guy,
Seemin' like I'm havin' fun.
He might look good it's true
But he's a substitute 'cause you were the perfect one.
[Chorus]
I need you, I need you.
Outside I'm masqueradin',
'Cause inside my hope is fading.
Like a clown since you put me down,
And my smile is my makeup I wear since my break up with you.
[Chorus: x2]"
"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you,
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling ""Yoo hoo,""
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
Let's go, Let's look at the show,
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
It's grand, Just holding your hand,
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land.
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you."
"(Dolly Parton)
Momma never seemed to miss the finer things in life
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
The only things that seemed to be important in her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Momma never wanted anymore than what she had
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
He often left her all alone
She didn't mind the stayin' home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers
And the gifts he never gave her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
And she didn't need those things to make her happy
She didn't even seem to notice
That he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
One morning we awoke
Just to find the note
That momma carefully wrote
And left to daddy
And as he began to read it
Our ears could not believe it
The words that she had written there to daddy
She said our kids are old enough
And they don't need me very much
So I've gone in search for love I need so badly
I have needed you so long
But I just can't keep holdin' on
She never meant to come back home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
Momma's gone
Good-bye to daddy"
"(Dolly Parton)
Stand back, and give me room
And listen to that beat
I got the music in my soul
And the rhythm in my feet
When I hear the music
You won't catch me standing still
And I won't miss a beat
I never have and I never will
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
I can dance to anything
That any band can play
I've got old-fashioned values
But I'm pretty up to date
And I know all the latest hits
On the radio
You don't have to join me
Stand back and watch my show
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
Thought I couldn't dance
Hey, watch me prance
Let's make romance
Thought I couldn't dance
You gotta take a chance
If you're gonna learn to dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
There's a lot of closet dancers
Just dyin' to come out
They dance alone inside their rooms
With the music way up loud
And I know you thought I couldn't dance
But I guess I sure fooled you
It just goes to show you never know
Who's wearing dancin' shoes
And you thought I couldn't dance
I'm full of surprises
And you thought I couldn't dance
It's too late now
I can't slow down...can't slow down
Oh, feel the heat
From these dancin' feet... can't slow down
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
Repeat..."
"(Blaise Tosti)
Love's a war we all survive, a never ending compromise
We always seem to say we're through, just to say tomorrow
Babe, I'm still in love with you
Every now and then we fight
So very sure we're both right
Saying things we never mean
Just to take them back tomorrow
And admit how wrong we've been
We're through forever 'til tomorrow
That's all we really seem to say
We can't go on with all this sorrow
We've got to find a better way
Many times we would fight and I would leave you
Then I'd find, just how much I really need you, and love you
Oh, oh, candle light, a glass of wine
Can bring back vision to the blind
Making love is sweet revenge
And when the battle's over
We're back in love, and we both win"
"I can see it on your face
It's over it's all over it's all over me and you
Love came down like the rains from heaven
Love's all over us dripping like the morning dew
We can't hide it anymore you can't hide real love
When it's all over all over me and you
And it's wonderful to know it's all over
Love sweet love it's all over me and you
Once we worried what folks would think if they only knew
Just how much love there was between me and you
Oh but it's no secret anymore it's all out in plain view
And love's all over us love's all over me and you
We can't hide it anymore..."
"(Dolly Parton)
I used to sit for hours as a kid
Dangle my feet from an old flat bridge,
Seein' myself in the water below
Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw
I recall a vacant old shack
Down by the edge of the tobaccer patch
A child's reflection in a dirty window
Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
I'm far from perfect, but I ain't all bad;
It hurts me more than it makes me mad
You gather your stones by stoopin' so low
Then shatter my image with the stones you throw
If you live in a glass house, don't throw stones
Don't shatter my image 'til you look at your own
Look at your reflection in your house of glass
Don't open my closet if your own's full of trash
Stay out of my closet if your own's full of trash
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
Don't shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw"
"Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you
Close the door to temptation
don't let me walk through
Turn away from me, darling
I'm begging you to
Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you
I belong to another
Whose arms have grown cold
But i promised forever
To have and to hold
I can never be free, dear
But when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing
The will to be true
Please help me, I'm falling
And that would be sin
Close the door to temptation
don't let me walk in
For i mustn't want you
But, darling, i do
Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you"
"GOOD UNDERSTANDING
Duet by Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner
Writer Dolly Parton
Copyright 1970
When we married we agreed that we'd both do as we please
Just as long as we done each other right
Through the years our love has grown now our love is twice as strong
Cause we've got a good understanding
Yes we've got a good understanding and a love that has never been demanding
We both love each other so and that's all we need to know
Cause we've got a good understanding
It's been your unselfish love that has always helped me up
When temptation reached out its hand to see
And when I could have gone wrong I would think of you at home
And I'd think about our good understanding
Yes we've got a good understanding..."
"(Dolly Parton)
Blue me, blue me
Blue is the color
That fits best on me
I'm blue
Just as blue as can be
Blue me, Blue me
I cry
And I die
I lie awake at night
And I question why
Must it be
I can never be free
Blue me, Blue me
My heart is heavy
But it's empty inside
No one to love me
Or to lay down beside
I'm blue
The queen of sorrow
Wears royal blue
My luck ain't changin'
Is it ever goin' to
I'm blue, Oh I'm blue
Why must I wear this robe of blue misery
Blue me, Blue me
Ooh
This sad old feeling
Is breakin' me down
No satisfaction with these blues hangin' 'round
Lord, I'm blue
Oh, I'm so blue Why can't I shake it tell me where will this end
When will I get out of this blue rut I'm in
Oh, I'm blue
Looks like the blues just took a liking to me
Blue me, Blue me Blue me, Blue me
Blue is the color that fits best on me
Ooooh, I'm blue
I'm just as blue as can be
Blue me
Blue me"
"(Dolly Parton)
You look at me that way
I know what your eyes say
Your eyes reflect love and desire
I see that you need me
I need you to please me
You touch me and set me on fire
It's the way that you love me
The way that you touch me
The way that you whisper my name
I cannot resist you
Each time I kiss you
Then everything goes up in flames
Baby I'm burning out of control
Baby I'm burning body and soul
Hot as a pistol of flaming desire
Baby I'm burning
You got me on fire
I'm on fire
This red hot emotion
Puts fireworks in motion
It looks like the fourth of July
There's no use in fighting
The fire you've ignited
Just stand back and watch the sparks fly
Baby I'm burning out of control
Baby I'm burning body and soul
Hot as a pistol of flaming desire
Baby I'm burning
You got me on fire
Baby I'm burning
Baby I'm burning
Baby I'm burning
Baby I'm burning
Baby I'm burning out of control
Baby I'm burning body and soul
Hot as a pistol of flaming desire
Baby I'm burning
You got me on fire
Baby I'm burning out of control
Baby I'm burning body and soul
Hot as a pistol of flaming desire
Baby I'm burning
You got me on fire
Baby I'm burning out of control
Baby I'm burning body and soul
Hot as a pistol of flaming desire
Baby I'm burning
You got me on fire"
"So often in my dreams
I hold you close against my skin
Waking up I wish that I could
Sleep and dream again
Cause only when I sleep
Can I not hear how it's a sin
How cheaters never win
Their heartaches never end
""Torn Between Two Lovers"" on the jukebox
And I'm thinking how I could've wrote that song
Wonderin' if God loves us, when we're cheatin'
But why he lets us feels things if it's wrong
I guess I should be singing ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"", some of those good songs
Can't find it in my heart to ask forgiveness
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
Thou shalt not commit it
It's written in the tin
The spirit is always willing
But the flesh is weak again
And you're as close to heaven
As I might ever fly
An angel in disguise
A wrong that feels so right
And Torn Between Two Lovers just keeps playing
And I don't wanna be right if lovin' you is wrong
It goes against all I've ever stood for
Knowin' I have someone else at home
I guess I should be singing ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"", some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart can tell on me tomorrow
Cause anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
To hell with heaven if it means I'll lose you
Anything that feels this right can't be that wrong
It just can't be"
"Back through the years I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
""Perhaps this coat will brang you good luck and happiness""
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colors that my momma made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my momma made for me
So with patches on my britches, holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
and my coat of many colors my momma made for me
And oh I couldn't understand that for I thought I was rich
And then I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed
And why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes
They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
One is only poor only if you choose to be
It is true we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors momma made for me
Made just for me"
"I'm gonna miss you, I'm gonna miss you
You fought a good fight, may you rest in peace now
You've earned the right, you stood brave and tall
The ultimate price, we honor you now
For God and country, you gave it all
And although I'm proud of all that you stood for
My selfish heart just wants you home
Your family and friends are all so proud of you
But I can't accept the fact that you're gone
And I'm gonna miss you
When the golden sun sinks slowly o'er the crest of yonder hill
I'm gonna miss you
In the wee hours of the mornin' when the world is calm and still
When I can see you, touch you, feel you, hear your heart beating true
Even though you're gone, my love lives on
And I, I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
Your touch, your smell, your kisses, and the comfort of your eyes
I'm gonna miss you
Your laughter, tears, your humor, and that crooked little smile
And I'm gonna miss the plans and dreams we had that never will come true
God wanted you, but I did too
And I, I'm gonna miss you
I'll miss you"
"In grave in my mind there are pictures mem'ries of a love I knew one time
So I find in my thoughts I stand looking
At the mem'ries hanging on the walls of my mind
I see a mem'ry of raindrops falling in the park on the day we met
Walking with each other through the rain laughing talking as we both got soak and wet
The mem'ry made that day I could never put away
That's the day he told me he'd be mine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
And I have a mem'ry of springtime cherry blossoms and bird singing on the vine
And the secret place we'd hide and laid together side by side
And the love that shined so brightly in his eyes
Springtime I recall was the sweetest time of all
That's the season our hearts became entwine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
Through the spring and summer he loved me and his love died with autumn leaves
His love was the wild and restless kind
When he left he left with me so many memories
He left them hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
Mhm mhm hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
He left them hanging on my mind"
"At my door the leaves are fallin'
A cold wild wind will come
Sweet hearts walked by together
And I still miss someone
I go out to a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Cause I still miss someone
Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there"
"Now I've been happy lately
Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun
Oh, I've been smiling lately
Dreaming about the world as one
And I believe it could be
Someday it's going to come
'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Peace train take this country
Come take me home again
Now I've been smiling lately
Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun
[Chorus]
Peace train sounding louder
Ride on the peace train
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah
Come on peace train
Peace train holy roller
Everyone jump on the peace train
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah
Come on peace train
Get your bags together
Go bring all your good friends, too
'cause it's getting nearer
Soon it will be with you
Now come and join the living
It's not so far from you
And it's getting nearer
Soon it will all be true
[Chorus]
Now I've been crying lately
Thinking about the world as it is
Why must we go on hating
Why can't we live in bliss
'cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Where peace train take this country
Come take me home again
[Chorus]
Peace train is sounding louder
Ride on the peace train
Ooh-wah-ee-ah-ooh-ah
Come on peace train
Peace train holy roller
Jump up on the peace train
Ride - ride on the peace train"
"You've seen me naked in more ways than one
You've seen me done up, seen me come undone
We've cried in the darkness, we've laughed in the sun
We've been forever, yet we've just begun
We've come full circle, all the way 'round
Through the good times and bad times, through life's ups and downs
Still we've stayed together through thick and through thin
Yes, we've come full circle, thank God, we're still friends
And you know the soft spots under my skin
Deep down inside me, where no one has been
We've sailed troubled waters, we've soared on the wind
But time's only sweetened this love that we're in
And we've come full circle, all the way 'round
Through the good times and bad times, through life's ups and downs
Still we've stayed together through thick and through thin
Yes, we've come full circle, thank God, we're still friends
We've cried in the darkness, laughed in the sun
We've come full circle and we've just begun
We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round
(We've come full circle)
We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round
You know we've cried in the darkness and we've laughed in the sun
(We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round)
But we've stayed together and we've just begun
(We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round)
I'm so glad you're still my friend
(We've come full circle, we've been all the way 'round)
We've come full circle"
"Lord take this badge off of me

Many years you have lingered around my cabin door
Oh hard times come again no more
Oh hard times come again no more
Oh hush a bye hard times, go ye away
Cause my hungry baby wants a Gingerbread Cake
Not a cow in the barn yard no money to spend
Not an egg in the hayloft, no little red hen
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
Oh, hush a bye hard times go ye to rest
Cause my ragged baby wants a new ruffled dress
And she wants some new shoes with buckles to wear
And she wants some silver bows for her golden hair
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
Hush a bye hard times go ye away
I don't intend to be treated this way
So, hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Don't cry no more
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more
Many years you have lingered around my cabin door
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Don't cry no more
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more"
"I'm watching the clock, it says five to five
The minutes are ticking so slow
I'm ready to stop, gonna close up the shop
So honey if you're ready lets go
Take out your pinstripe suit
And your fancy cowboy boots
Now ain't it a crime when you're lookin' so fine
And tonight you're mine, all mine
Chorus:
Packin' it up, movin' on out
Headed up to the big town
Sure like them big city lights on a Saturday night
Coming in from the country
Second Chorus:
Packin it up, movin' on out
Headed up to the big town
Sure like those big city lights on a Saturday night
Coming in from the country
Take off my blue jeans
Slip on the hottest dress that you've ever seen
Just like an ad in a fashion magazine
It's you and me babe, a sight for sore eyes to see
Take in a movie or maybe a show
Dance all night just letting it go
Champagne and roses waiting back at our suite
So kick off your boots and make sweet love to me
Repeat Second Chorus 3X
Repeat Second Chorus To Fade"
"The neon lights of a movie marquee
Says the show today is Love Is Free
And inside a boy and a girl on a date
Their folks are gone away they're gonna stay out late
A little later on in a lover's lane
They park in the dark with their hearts in flames
He says oh baby go along with me
I need you so and love is free
In a simple little room in a Chatanooga home
For girls that need a friend and are all alone
She waits for a letter that never comes
From a boy that won't admit what he's done
She had to leave school cause she couldn't stand the shame
Her daddy said she ruined the family name
Her mama cries herself to sleep at night
That's no way to start a young girl's life
Love isn't free no it ain't free
No matter what they say somebody has to pay for love
In an orphanage home a sad little girl
Six years old and all alone in the world
She knows by now what they never say
That she once had a mom but she gave her away
People come to visit but don't choose Marie
She cries at the door nobody loves me
And somewhere a boy doesn't care at all
That her tear at night stains her little rag doll"
"(Dolly Parton)
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I love you, I do, but I can't be true
Men are my weakness I've got a roving eye
And I've fallen victim to many a smile
I just love the excitement of love when it's new
I'm just a hopeless romantic so I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, nothin' to do with you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true
Some play it safe while some like it hot
I guess you could say I never knew when to stop
But when I'm lovin' you, I'll give it all that I got
It might be different with you to know I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules
Now that you know it's true, I'll leave the rest up to you
I'll be good to you, but I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
It's a weakness of mine, its not a weakness in you
So don't expect it of me though I expect it of you
I really love you, I do, but I can't be true, I can't be true
I can't be true no matter what I do
Oh I get around, and I break all of the rules
Now that you know it's true, I'll leave the rest up to you
I'll be good to you, but I can't be true, I can't be true"
"Why why why did you say goodbye
Why did you walk out on me
Cry cry cry I feel like I could die
Why did you go and leave me lonely
What did I do
What did I say
To make you just walk out and leave me this way
Please come back and tell me
What I did wrong
And I'll make it up to you
If you'll just come back home
I'll try try try as each day goes by
To make you glad that you came back to me
No more good-byes and no more tears to cry
Every day I'll try to make you happy
What did I do
What did I say
To make you just walk out and leave me this way
Please come back and tell me
What I did wrong
And I'll make it up to you
If you'll just come back home
I'll try try try as each day goes by
To make you glad that you came back to me
No more good-byes and no more tears to cry
Every day I'll try to make you happy"

Backstory:
Tabloid prediction: Dolly Parton will announce she's falling madly in love with a 300 pound professional wrestler. She'll write a song about their relationship titled ""Headlock on My Heart"" and feature her massive muscleman in the video.
Dolly: Now this actually came out in this magazine. Now, you folks I'm sure buy these every week at the supermarket, right? And you know they never put anything in these magazines that's not true, right? So I figured since I was gonna fall in love anyhow, why wait? So I went out and I found me a 300 pound wrestler and I sat down and I wrote a song called ""Headlock on My Heart"" and I did a video. As a matter of fact, in the same magazine on a page opposite, there was a picture of Hulk Hogan. Now, I love Hulk Hogan. My Daddy's crazy about him, so I called Hulk, I said ""Would you do this?"" 'Cause the song is a fantasy, and it's about a guy named Starlight Starbright. He said ""Aw sure, I'd do anything with you, Dolly!"" I said ""Well, thanks, Hulk, I ought to hug your neck!"" So wouldn't that be something if me and Hulk really wound up getting married? Watch this video...
Song:
The first time that I saw him
Was in a wrestling magazine.
Then I watched him on TV,
Then I bought a ringside seat.
His name was Starlight Starbright,
The greatest in the land.
He sprinkled stardust in my eyes
I was his biggest fan.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Referee: 300 pounds of magic right here in the ring tonight.
Starlight Starbright: Wrestling fans, big and small, who's the greatest of them all?
Dolly: Starlight! Starlight Starbright! Starlight! Starlight Starbright!
He dazzled 'em with brilliance,
He outshined all the rest.
And I loved the heart that beat
Beneath his massive golden chest.
Spoken:
Dolly: In this ring, I thee wed.
Referee: Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
Starlight Starbright: I do!
Referee: And do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
Dolly: I do, I truly do!
Referee: I now pronounce you man and wife.
Dolly: Uh, you may now kiss the bride.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Dolly: Well, it's a whole new arena for me,
But it's a whole new wrestling match for him.
I guess you could say he pinned me down for a lifetime.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart."
"As we were dressing to go out our little girl and boy
Came in and asked if they could go this time
We told them little girls and boys don't belong at parties
And that they should be in bed asleep by nine
The babysitter came in then and we kissed the kids goodbye
And told them that we'd be home soon and told them not to cry
Then we left for the party like we'd so often done
Thinking only of ourselves and not our little ones
The party started out wild and it grew wilder as the night wore on
With drinking laughing telling dirty jokes nobody thinkin' of home
Then the strangest feeling came over me and it chilled me to the bones
And I told my wife that we'd better leave the party
Cause I felt that we were needed at home
As we rode along I got to thinking of how the kids that morning
Had asked if we would take them to church the next day
And how I'd put 'em off like I'd so often done
By saying we'd probably get home too late
Then my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of sirens
As they cut through the still night air
Then we turned down our street that's when we saw the fire
The rest was like a nightmare
We took their little bodies to church the next day
Though we'd left the party early we still got home too late"
"(Dolly Parton)
Say forever you'll be mine
Forever is the love that is filled with understanding
Forever is the love that is true and undemanding
Forever is the love that can stand the test of time
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Trouble clouds may fill our skies
It might even rain awhile
But the rain will go away
There's always a brighter day
Darling, I won't promise you
That we'll be happy all the time
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Say forever you'll be mine, forever I am yours
And I'll do anything that you ever ask me to
And I'll do what you want me to"
"In the presence of you I wonder
Why I can't say the things that I want to
All the pretty words that I planned to say when I'm with you
I lose them in the presence of you
Your nearness makes my voice tremble
There's a weakness that I feel through and through
Searching for words to describe how I love you
Don't come easy in the presence of you
Love and admiration might make my words silent
But feelings say more than words do
And the feeling of loving you is all around me
Anytime I'm in the presence of you
Love and admiration might make my words silent..."
"(Dolly Parton)
Many years you have lingered around my cabin door
Oh hard times come again no more
Oh hard times come again no more
Oh hush a bye hard times, go ye away
Cause my hungry baby wants a Gingerbread Cake
Not a cow in the barn yard no money to spend
Not an egg in the hayloft, no little red hen
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
Oh, hush a bye hard times go ye to rest
Cause my ragged baby wants a new ruffled dress
And she wants some new shoes with buckles to wear
And she wants some silver bows for her golden hair
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
Hush a bye hard times go ye away
I don't intend to be treated this way
So, hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Don't cry no more
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more
Many years you have lingered around my cabin door
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Don't cry no more
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more"
"(Dolly Parton)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, what will do I with you gone?
Sitting in my lonely room just staring at the wall
For lack of something else to do I count the tears that fall
Trying to get it through my head you don't care at all
What am I gonna do with you gone?
What does life hold for me anymore?
With you gone what once mattered don't matter no more
You still have the key to my heart and my door
What am I gonna do with you gone, with you gone?
I can hear the lonesome whistle of a passing train
I can feel my heart beat a rhythm with the pouring rain
Realizing that my life won't ever be the same
What am I gonna do with you gone?
Will I ever be happy again?
With you gone my whole world has just come to an end
Will I ever forget you, or will I forget
What am I gonna do with you gone, with you gone?
With you gone, What does life hold for me anymore?
With you gone what once mattered don't matter no more
And you still have the key to my heart and my door
What am I gonna do with you gone, with you gone?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, what will do I with you gone?"
"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you"
"When the mornin' sun
Streaks across my room
And I'm wakin' up
From another dream of you
Yes, you know I'm on the road
Once again it seems
All that's left behind
Is a chain of broken dreams
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you
And how I wish that love
Was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have
'Cause I've got so much to give
But ya' know I feel so sad
Down inside my heart
That the dollar sign
Should be keepin' us apart
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
And if only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life
Had not yet crossed my mind
And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come runnin' back to you
I'd come runnin' back to you
But you know we can't
Live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent
So I must leave you all alone
'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago
And now this travelin' life
Well, it's the only life I know
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know I love you
But you know I love you
Oh, I love you
But you know that I love you
But you know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know that I love you
But you know that I love you"
"Don't look at me with love in your eyes
Go look at somebody that can make it worthwhile
I'm hurt from a love affair I didn't want in
I'm in no condition to try to love again
Don't smile at me because it's no use
'Cause I don't have a smile that I can give to you
Someday, you might look me up, but let me be till then
For I'm in no condition to try to love again
I'm in no condition to try to love again
Man I love just broke my heart
And it must have time to mend
He have me the breeze
Now he's gone with the wind
I'm in no condition to try to love again
I'm in no condition to try to love again
Man I love just broke my heart
And it must have time to mend
He have me the breeze
Now he's gone with the wind
I'm in no condition to try to love again"
"What a friend we have in Jesus all our sins and grieves to bear
And what a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer
Can we find a friend so faithful who will all our burden share
We should never be discouraged take it to the Lord in prayer
What a friend we have in Jesus...
What a friend we have in Jesus"
"I've been sittin' here looking at the clock big daddy
Allready you're a half hour late.
I've been pulling back the curtains, peeping out the window
Wish you wouldn't make me wait
You better move it on home, boy, you better move it on home.
I've been sittin' here listening to the jukebox playing
And forgettin' where I ought to be.
Zipping on a cool one having me some good fun
Time got away from me.
I better move it on home, I better move it on home.
[Chorus]
Better spin them wheels and make it on back
To heaven on earth and lovers' at
Like a rolling stone, you better move it on home.
I've been here cooking you a nice hot supper
And you can't even eat it on time
Heating up the meat loaf and stiring up the gravy
Is kind a messing up my mind
You better move it on home boy, you better move it on home.
I've been speeding through the traffic, passing everyone
I remember what I forgot.
Stepping on the gas and driving kind of fast
Hoping I won't get stopped.
Better move it on home, better move it on home.
[Chorus: x 2]
She: Better move it on home, boy right on this time or I'm gonna shake it.
He: I'm on my way babe, but the traffic is murder
She: That's what I thought the trouble is at home, if you're not at home soon.
He: Traffic is messing up my mind
She: ... and you're messing up mine."
"[Chorus]
I've been higher than the high sierra
Lower than death valley must be
I've been right, mostly wrong
Wrong about you, right about me
The way I feel, can't explain
So much passion turned to pain
The sun still shines most of the time
Did you know the sun shines when it rains
[Chorus]
I've been cussed and I've been praised
And I've been nothing these days
But I'll come back, time will see
If I'm wrong about you, right about me"
"I gave all the giving and I took all the taking
I gave all my love to you and I took all your hurt
I treated you so good but you treated me like dirt
They say love is give and take now my poor heart is breaking
I gave all the giving and I took all the taking
I always gave you everything that I knew how to give
You always took advantage of me you knew I would forgive
I treated you too good for my own good now I'm alone and left forsaken
I gave all the giving and I took all the taking
The giving and the taking have caused my heart to break
I've given all that I can give and I've taken all that I can take
[ guitar ]
The givng and the taking..."

"I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on
I've traveled around this country crossed the waters deep and wide
Made lots of friends and memories brought joy to other's lives
It's Christmas time again another year has come and gone
And I can't keep from wonderin' how the old folks are at home
I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on
When the snow is on the meadow and the sleigh bells jingle bright
And the kids are singing jingle bells around the Christmas lights
As daddy stokes the fire and mama puts the turkey on
There ain't nothing going to slow me down this Christmas I'll be home
I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents turn the Christmas music on
This Christmas I'll be home with bells on"
"Lookin' outta my windowpane
Tears minglin' with the rain
I'm so lonesome I could cry, just like old Hank
Starin' down on the city street
Feelin' empty and incomplete
There's a place I need to be to fill my tank
A place I can go where I can be free
Where I can be happy and I just be me
Ho-o-ome
Where the warm wind's blowin' and the river's flowin' along
Like a lazy bum in the midday sun
And I've gone fishin' with my pole at the fishin' hole
Where I can lay down my heavy load
And know that I am always welcome home
I left home I was seventeen
I had a lot of ambitious dreams
Seen a lot of those dreams come true, I've had good luck
I ain't complain' that's for sure
I got a lot to be thankful for
One of those things is a magic door that opens up
Back to the time when I was a kid
To the sounds of crickets and the katydids
It's called ho-o-ome
On the front porch swingin'
And the fern pots hangin'
Ho-o-ome
With the church bells ringin'
And voices singin'
Those old songs that mend my mind like a stitch in time
Where the tea is sweet and the love complete
Oh me, I wanna go ho-o-ome
I often think about where I have been
Where I am goin' and that's about when I think about
Ho-o-ome
Where the soul finds comfort and the heart finds pleasure
Ho-o-ome
Where the depths of love is hard to measure
It's ho-o-ome
I hear you callin', I hear you callin'
I'll never be lost as long as I know
There's place like that where I can go
Where I can restore my weary soul
On the mountain slopes in the soft blue smoke
Of ho-o-ome
Home sweeet home. Ho-o-ome
Back to the hills with the whippoorwills
Of ho-o-ome
With the fireflies blinkin' and the night stars winkin'
Ho-o-ome
Honeysuckle vine and Muscadine wine
At ho-o-ome
Where the ginseng grows in the shady groves of ho-o-ome
With family and friends and joy that never ends
Ho-o-ome
There's no place like it, no place like it
Ho-ome"
"(Frieda Parton/Mark Andersen)
You may not know me now
But I have been around
You'll never see my name on any pages
I'm just the common man
The fool who understands
The pain you go through
When life takes you under
So, sing for the common man
A song for the common man
He paid for the song with the sweat of his brow
He will survive, he will survive
You may not know my mother
My sisters or my brothers
Yet everyone has given for the other
You know the working man
He builds what others plan
So, everyone of us should sing his story
So, sing for the common man
A song for the common man
He paid for the song with the sweat of his brow
He will survive, he will survive
Dat after day
He keeps working away
In offices, factories, and farms
Year after year
He sheds tear after tear
He will provide, he will survive
So, sing for the common man
A song for the common man
He paid for the song with the sweat of his brow
He will survive, he will survive"
"Am I to face these lonely halls alone
And when you leave, who's gonna walk me home
Cause when you walk out the door I won't see you no more
And you're the one I adore so baby
Chorus:
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't be a fool
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)
You're old enough to know you're too young to face the world so cruel
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)
You're not prepared to do anything
So if you wanna buy me that diamond ring, well
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't drop out
My parents say you're lazy but you can be smart if you try
And I know you've got a heart cause you've never ever made me cry
They say you're no good so baby do what you should
And stay here by my side oh darlin'
Repeat Chorus
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)
Don't drop out of my life
Baby, don't drop out
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)"

Yes I see God where the mountains reach the sky
And I see God when the eagle starts to fly
I see God in a little baby's smile I see God and he makes my life worthwhile
Yes I see God when the bridegroom meets his bride
I see God in a father's loving eyes
I see God when a mother starts to cry I see God in a love that never dies
(I see God) where the people meet to pray (I see God) in the things they do and
say
(I see God) when the little children play
I see God and I know he's near all way
I see God yes I see God"
"Trouble, we have known trouble
In our struggle just to get by
Many times the burden's been heavy
Still we carried on side by side
[Chorus]
And when we're gone long gone
The only thing that will have mattered
Is the love that we shared
And the way that we cared
When we're gone, long gone
And when we're walking together in glory
Hand in hand through eternity
It's the love that will be remembered
Not wealth, not poverty
[Chorus]"
"We three kings of Orient are, bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain moor and mountain following yonder star
Born a king on Bethlehem's plain, gold I bring to crown Him again
King forever, ceasing never over us all to reign
Star of wonder, star of night, star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding guide us to Thy perfect light
Frankincense and moor have I, my gift of love and sacrifice
Prayer and praising all men raising worshiping God most high
Oh, star of wonder, star of night, star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding guide us ti Thy perfect light
We three kings of Orient are, bearing gifts we traverse afar,we three kings"
"Well my wife and I were happy in our trailer
But she didn't dig my runnin' around all night
Well I warned you a couple of times of leavin'
Oh but you just laughed and took it kinda light
Well I should've paid attention to her warnin'
When she told me she'd leave if I didn't change
Cause when I come home about sunup this mornin'
Well I detected something mighty strange
Her and the car and the mobile home are gone boys
I was takin' off while you was a carryin' on
Now things are really shot I came home to an empty lot
Yeah me and the car and the mobile home was gone
Yeas her and the car and the mobile home was gone
Well the neighbors all around me were a laughin'
And it made me feel about ten inches tall
Ha I knew you didn't think that I'd really leave you
Ah not to mention taking home and all
Well talk about somebody be-wildered
I bet you didn't know what to do nor where to go
I found a little consolation in my wardrobe
That you left scattered on the patio
Her and the car and the mobile home..."
"(E. Kaz)
Of all the roads I've traveled and all the sights I've seen
The most amazing thing is the power of our dreams
And anything is possible for those who can believe
Just get your heart to rearrange its priorities
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
It takes faith in one another to see things eye to eye
And it's hard to trust but you know it's worth the try
There's a candle in my window and whenever you feel blue
You can bet your bottom dollar I'll be there for you
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little bit harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
Oh I do believe in miracles
But I know they don't come easy
So why don't we give destiny
A helping hand
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little bit harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
Life is just too beautiful
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work"

When your eyes meet mine my heart beats out of time
And I burn with desire through and through
I can't help myself I can't see no one else cause my eyes can only see you
My eyes can only see you my eyes can only see you
Your face is always in view for my eyes can only see you
I want you so much and I long for your touch and your eyes tell me you want me
too
Oh it may not be right but I'm too weak to fight and my eyes can only see you
My eyes can only see you...
And my eyes can only see you"
"Fight and scratch fight and scratch that's all we ever do
There surely must be more to love than to fight and scratch with you
You you to fight and scratch with you
Well you just bought a foal last month now you want a wig
It looks like you couldn't understand my paycheck ain't that big
Well what about the dough you lose in them poker games downtown
(I figured you'd mention that smart aleck)
Yeah and that brand new boat and that fishin' gear
But no uhhuh I don't reckon that'd count really
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Sometimes I swear I think that you're the devil in disguise
Cause when you're mad you oughta see the fire fly from your eyes
Well you don't look so cute yourself when you're mad at me
And if you don't like the way I look then you know how to leave
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Well I love you and you love me but we're always findin' fault
But the way we fight you wouldn't know we had any love at all
We just fight like cats and dogs we'll leave then come right back
For what excitement would we have if we didn't fight and scratch
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Why don't you drop dead oh you'd like me to and I'll live forever just for spite
Why don't you keep your big mouth shot
Well why don't you just make me if you think you're big enough
Yeah and I could whip you with both hands tied behind
Yeah you just try it with me and I'll knock your brains out
With a stick of soap that's good Catfish
What's a catfish why'd you call me that
They're all mouth and no brains boy that's really good
It's all I can do to keep from laughin' hah
That's funny you sure are a funny little fellow"
"Sometimes I think of you and tears fill my eyes
To think of the meaning youve given my life
Youve touched me in places no one ever reached
Youve given me reason and cause to believe
You are my rainbow, youve colored my life
And you are my sunshine, Im warm in your light
You are my fountain that never runs dry
Youre my inspiration, my reason to try
Ill love you til green grass turns lavender blue
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew
Til horses and chariots chase down the wind
Thats when Ill leave you, Ill love you til then
Ill love you til green grass turns lavender blue
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew
Til horses and chariots chase down the wind
Thats when Ill leave you, Ill love you til then
Ill love you til green grass turns lavender blue
And all the stars fall from heaven and vanish like dew
Til horses and chariots chase down the wind
Thats when Ill leave you, Ill love you til then
Thats when Ill leave you, yes
Ill leave you then
Ill need you til then
Ill love you til then"
"You say tomorrow you're going
It's so hard for me to believe
I'm making plans for the heartaches
'Cause you're making plans to leave
The tears for me will be falling
Like a tree shedding its leaves
I'm making plans for the tear drops
'Cause you're making plans to leave
You're making plans to forget me
I'm making plans to miss you
I'm getting ready to grieve
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave"
"I am a seeker, a poor sinful creature
There is no weaker than I am
I am a seeker, you are a teacher
You are a reacher, so reach down
Won't you reach out and lead me
Guide me and keep me
In the shelter of your care each day
'Cause I am a seeker, you are a keeper
You are the leader, won't you show me the way?
I am a vessel that's empty and useless
I am a bad seed that fell by the way
I am a loser that wants to be a winner
And you are my last hope
Don't turn me away
I am a seeker, a poor sinful creature
There is no weaker than I am
I am a seeker, you are a teacher
You are a reacher, so reach down
Won't you reach out and lead me
Guide me and keep me, Lord
In the shelter of your care each day
'Cause I am a seeker, you are a keeper
You are the leader, won't you show me the way?
Oh, I know you are a mountain
From which there flows a fountain
So let it's water wash my sins away
'Cause I am a seeker, you are a keeper
You are the leader, won't you show me the way?"
"(Dolly Parton)
Blue me, blue me
Blue is the color
That fits best on me
I'm blue
Just as blue as can be
Blue me, Blue me
I cry
And I die
I lie awake at night
And I question why
Must it be
I can never be free
Blue me, Blue me
My heart is heavy
But it's empty inside
No one to love me
Or to lay down beside
I'm blue
The queen of sorrow
Wears royal blue
My luck ain't changin'
Is it ever goin' to
I'm blue, Oh I'm blue
Why must I wear this robe of blue misery
Blue me, Blue me
Ooh
This sad old feeling
Is breakin' me down
No satisfaction with these blues hangin' 'round
Lord, I'm blue
Oh, I'm so blue Why can't I shake it tell me where will this end
When will I get out of this blue rut I'm in
Oh, I'm blue
Looks like the blues just took a liking to me
Blue me, Blue me Blue me, Blue me
Blue is the color that fits best on me
Ooooh, I'm blue
I'm just as blue as can be
Blue me
Blue me"

We got too much of a good thing goin'
We got too much to let it slide
We got too much of a feelin' flowing
We got too much, got too much to let it die
Whatcha try'n to tell me, boy?
Whatcha try'n to do to me?
You know you're my pride and joy
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Around you my world revolves
Its a problem we can solve
Can it really be so involved we can't work it out?
We'll work it out
'Cause we got too much of a good thing goin'
We got too much to let it slide
Yeah we got too much of a feelin' flowing
We got too much, got too much to let it die
Won't you talk to me tonight?
Let me hold you and love you right
Nobody's gonna know those eyes
The way I do, I do know you
Maybe she's your fantasy
She can't love you more than me
Just touch me and you will see
You're forever mine, forever mine
'Cause we got too much of a good thing goin'
We got too much to let it slide
Yeah we got too much of a feelin' flowing
We got too much, got too much to let it die
Tell me what it is you want, what it is you need
What it is that I ain't that I should be
I'll play your games, I'll be your fool
If you want me to learn, then take me to school
Maybe I'll show you
We got too much of a good thing goin'
We got too much to let it slide
Yeah we got too much of a feelin' flowing
We got too much, got too much to let it die
Yeah we got too much, we got too much
We got too much, we got too much
We got too much, we got too much
We got too much, got too much to let it die
We got too much of a good thing goin'
We got too much to let it slide
Yeah we got too much of a feelin' flowing
We got too much, got too much to let it die"
"THE TWELFTH OF NEVER

WRITERS JERRY LIVINGSTON, PAUL FRANCIS WEBSTER
You ask me how much I need you, must I explain? I need you, oh my darling, like roses need rain You ask how long I'll love you, I'll tell you true Until the Twelfth of Never, I'll still be loving you Hold me close, never let me go Hold me close, melt my heart like April snow I'll love you 'til the bluebells forget to bloom I'll love you 'til the clover has lost its perfume I'll love you 'til the poets run out of rhyme Until the Twelfth of Never and that's a long, long time Until the Twelfth of Never and that's a long, long time"
"Everybody wants to find a love
Somebody, somebody who will always care
We get locked up in our own worlds
With feelings and secrets we're afraid to share
But all I have to do is see you smile
And maybe, just maybe if I brush your hand
Something happens, I cannot explain
And somehow, oh, somehow I can understand
I, I think you're gonna find
Gonna find you, gonna find you
I'm reading your mind
I know you by heart
And you're so much a part of me
I know you by heart, yes, I do
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by heart
I know every time you're gonna call
I pick up the phone before it ever rings
And when you need some lovin'
I'll be there beside you, anticipating everything
Oh, it's like I always said
You're the one I want
All I want is you
I'm inside your head
I know you by heart
Girl, you're so much a part of me
I know you by heart, yes, I do
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by heart
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by heart
I know you by heart
And you're so much a part of me
I know you by heart, I know you, I know you, I know you
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by"
"Rudolf, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw him,
You would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolf
Play in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say:
""Rudolf with your nose so bright,
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then all the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee:
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
You'll go down in history!"""
"I don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you've promised
Beneath the halo moon
But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrows
While you play your cheatin' game
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind
You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind
You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine"
"(Dolly Parton)
My train of thought was broken by a sudden burst of laughter
Something badly needed to lighten up the chores
Seemed old Mrs. Bailey had accidentally fell
In the water being used to scrub the floors
Now Mrs. Bailey was the meanest matron at the home
She believed in lots of work with little play
And we laughed till we bent double
Though we knew we'd get in trouble
But trouble's all we had at evening shade
Now evening shade was where they claim to teach you understanding
To teach you love and keep you off the streets
And all the kids that live there are said to be a problem
Juvenile delinquents so to speak
But understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger
An iron hand has no gentle touch and love ain't learned from hate
The reason we were there is 'cause we had no one who cared
But they cared even less at evening shade
Little Susan Bradley, one night had wet her bed
Mrs. Bailey took the razor strap and beat her half to death
And I knew that something must be done to put an end to this
And so I started talking plans with the older kids
Plans were that Joe Johnson would steal the kerosene
And I would get some matches when nobody seen
Beckie Adams would make sure the kids were all outside
Billy Watson would look out for the evil eye
Now Mrs. Bailey took a nap at three o'clock each day
We knew that she'd be a'sleeping as the plans got underway
Now that its all over and the sun is going down
There's no evening shade because we burned it to the ground
Evening Shade was burning just like the hell it was"
"Just a few old memories
Slipped in through my door
Though I thought I had closed it
So tightly before
I can't understand it
Why it should bother my mind
For it all belongs to another place and time
Just a few old keep-sakes
Way back on the shelf
No, they don't mean nothin'
Well I'm surprised they're still left
Just a few old love letters
With the edges all brown
And an old faded picture
I keep turned upside-down
Just a few old memories
Going way back in time
Well I can hardly remember
I don't know why I'm cryin'
I can't understand it
Well I'm surprised myself
First thing tomorrow morning
I'll clean off that shelf
Just a few old keep-sakes
Way back on the shelf
No, they don't mean nothin'
Well I'm surprised that they're left
Just a few old love letters
With their edges all brown
And an old faded picture
I keep turned upside-down"
"A mother sings as she rocks her babies
Children sing the noted nursery rhymes
The old church bell is ringing for the Sunday morning singing
Music is as old as the time
As the farmer works the fields he sings a song
The songbirds in the trees sing along
And the wind makes melodies as it whistles through the trees
Man's burdens are made lighter with a song
There'll always be music as long as there's a story to be told
There'll always be music cause music is the voice of the soul
There'll always be music
Rain makes rhytmic sounds when it's falling
There's music in a new born baby's cry
There's music all around and there is no sweeter sound
For that's the way a man expresses life
In heaven there's a choir of angels singing
We often heard about God's angel band
Music will live on when men on earth are gone
There'll still be music in that promised land
There'll always be music..."
"(Dolly Parton)
Thumbing for a ride by the edge of the road
With a brown paper bag to hold my clothes
But tonight I'm going home where I belong
If the good lord's willing and the creek don't rise
And if my luck holds out, and I catch me a ride
When the sun goes down tomorrow, I should be home
This big city ain't no kind of place
For a country girl with a friendly face
If you smile people look at your funny, they take it wrong
They laugh at my talkin' and clothes I wear
They put me down and they call me square
But tonight I'm going home where I belong
I'm goin' back to the people I love
Back to the place that I dream of
It's true that there's no place like home sweet home
The one I want to see the most
Is the boy who begged me not to go
When the sun goes down tomorrow
Tonight I'm going back where I belong"
"When you feel the pain of loneliness inside you
And you feel the emptiness that lives within
When all the things around you had no meaning
And the lips you love can kiss you once and then
That's when love will mean the most
That's when love will hold you close
To the lips you love to touch and the things that mean so much
That's when love will mean the most
[ steel ]
When you see a gentle smile from one that loves you
I feel a softness in the touch of love's sweet hand
Or just reminiscing back through childhood mem'ries
Of days gone by that can't return again
TThat's when love will mean the most..."
"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop
And told his plans to me, so
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
[Chorus]
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town"
"(Dolly Parton)
Her two little feet would come running into
Our bedroom almost every night
Her soft little face would be wet from her tears
And her little heart pounding with fright
She'd hold out her arms, then she'd climb in beside us
In her small voice, we'd hear her remark
""Mommie and Daddy, can I sleep here with you
'Cause Jeannie's afraid of the dark""
One day in the summer, we took some flowers
To place on some old family graves
Jeannie said, ""Mommy, ain't it dark in the ground
Oh, Daddy, I'd be so afraid""
Then she looked up at her daddy and me
And said somethin' that broke both our hearts
She said, ""When I die, please don't bury me
'Cause Jeannie's afraid of the dark""
Jeannie was always afraid of the dark
And we never could understand why
'Cause we looked after Jeannie with the very best of care
Because Jeannie was our only child
Perhaps it was death that she was so afraid of
'Cause it took her one dark stormy night
I think we always knew that we'd never see Jeannie grown
'Cause it seemed she was destined to die
But on Jeannie's grave, we placed an eternal flame
That glows and never loses its spark
And on the darkest night, there's always a light
'Cause Jeannie's afraid of the dark
Our Jeannie's afraid of the dark"
"I'm comin' home, I've done my time
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine
If you received my letter telling you, I'd soon be free
Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me, if you still want me
Whoa, tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
It's been three long years, do you still want me?
If I don't see a ribbon 'round the old oak tree
I'll stay on the bus forget about us, put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
Bus driver, please look for me
'Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see
I'm really still in prison and my love, she holds the key
A simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free
I wrote and told her please
Whoa, tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
It's been three long years, do you still want me?
If I don't see a ribbon 'round the old oak tree
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us, put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree"
"(Dolly Parton)
Once upon a memory
I kissed lips as sweet as honey
And lived in Heaven with an angel
For a little while
I knew love sweet and tender
In a world of perfect splendor
Once upon a memory
Before he said goodbye
Once upon a memory
In Never-Neverland
I had a love I know I'll
Never ever have again
A love like those
You read in fairy tales
Filled with joy and laughter
Oh, but he ended it
And it broke my heart
And I've cried forever-after
Once upon a memory
I knew love beyond compare
Oh, then his sweet lips
Lost their sweetness
And all that Heaven in his eyes
Turned into a cold and distant stare
Gone is the love, sweet and tender
A world of heartache knows no splendor
Oh, but once, once upon a memory
I knew love beyond compare
Yes, once upon a memory
In Never-Neverland
I had a love I know I'll
Never ever have again
A love like those
You read in fairy tales
Filled with joy and laughter
But he ended it
And it broke my heart
And I've cried forever-after
Oh, but once, once upon a memory
I knew love beyond compare
That was once upon a memory"
"(Dolly Parton)
I love you, I love you
My heart seems to whisper
But my lips cannot form those words
I know my heart
Is calling out to you
In a voice you've already heard
Does your heart feel as if
It could burst any second
Is it racing, will not slow up
Do you just want to be
With me endlessly
Well I'm thinking
We might be in love
We might be in love
The best I can tell
I thinkin' thoughts
That I've never pondered
And I'm feeling like I've never felt
It's like I drink
From some magic posion
Sipping from your loving cup
Intoxicated, infatuated
I'm thinking we might be in love
We might be in love
What else could it be
These feelings of wonder
Passion and romance
Excitement and pure ectasy
We might be in love
And it might be forever
I think there's a future for us
If you just want to be
In and all over me
It might be, we might be in love
I promise for keeps
If you're feeling like me
Then it might be
We might be in love
I dare say
We might be in love"
"You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love can drive a girl insane
You broke my will oh but what a thrill
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
I like that love cause i thought it was funny
You came along and you move me honey
I change my mind this love is sure fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
[Chorus]
Ooh kiss me baby, ooh it feels good
Ooh hold me, hold me, i would love to love you
Like a lover should
'cause you're fine, and so kind
I tell the world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine
I chew my nails and i twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous but it sure is fun
You broke my will but i love you still and
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
Ooh kiss my baby, ooh it feels good, ooh hold me
Baby, you ought to love me like a lover should
'cause you're fine, and so kind
I tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine
I love that you love cause i thought it was funny
You came along and you move me honey
I change my mind, this love is sure fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
Kiss me baby, ooh it feels good
Ooh hold me, hold me
You ought to love me like a lover should
'cause you're fine and so kind
I tell the world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine
I chew my nails and i twiddle my thumbs
I sure am nervous
But i'm sure havin' fun
I change my mind, this love is sure fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, you broke my will, but what a thrill
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
You broke my will but i love you still
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
Goodness gracious great balls of fire"
"I couldn't wait forever
Did you expect me to
I guess you thought I'd never
Find somebody new
I lived on dreams and promises
As long as I could
I couldn't wait forever
The way you thought I would
The lonely nights grew longer
As I prayed for time to fly
I lived on hopes that you'd return
And that's how I got by
The agony of loneliness
Just got too much for me
I couldn't wait forever
Needing love so desperately
So I found new lips to kiss me
New arms to hold me tight
I found new love and happiness
To fill these empty nights
You took my love for granted
Now my heart has found a new home
I couldn't wait forever
Forever's just too long
I couldn't wait forever
Forever's just too long"
"I ain't got no business here
You have made it very clear
So I'm leaving
Leaving this old town
My wings are kinda broken up
But I think I might can patch 'em up
Heaven help me
Lord, you got an angel down
Time and only time can tell
If I'm to find Heaven or Hell
Then I'm leaving
I'm just leaving
I have given all I can
I've tried but you don't understand
So I'm leaving
I'm talking big for someone so small
I know I'll be alright out there
Even so, I'm just a little scared
But that's strictly just between us
And that's all
I'm gonna be alright
I'm going to Paradise
I'm leaving
Just leaving
Time and only time can tell
If I'm to find Heaven or Hell
But I'm leaving
I'm just leaving
My wings are kinda broken up
But I think I might can patch 'em up
Heaven help me
Lord, you've got an angel down
I'm leaving
I'm leaving this old town
Leaving
I'm leaving
Lord, you've an angel down
I'm leaving this old town
I'm just leaving"
"Back through the years I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
""Perhaps this coat will brang you good luck and happiness""
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colors that my momma made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my momma made for me
So with patches on my britches, holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
and my coat of many colors my momma made for me
And oh I couldn't understand that for I thought I was rich
And then I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed
And why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes
They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
One is only poor only if you choose to be
It is true we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors momma made for me
Made just for me"
"(Dolly Parton)
Like the Phoenix
From the ash and dirt
I rose up from the pain and hurt
When I was at my very worst
I found you
Thought I could never love again
When a spark of light came beaming in
A thread of hope
For me to spin around you
Chorus:
Unlikely Angel
Standing there in front of me
As if you were my destiny
Like we were always meant to be together
Unlikely Angel
It feels so right inside your love
Like God has sent you from above
To honor, cherish, and to love forever
The smile upon your angel face
The heaven in your eyes replace
The hell that I've been going through
Before you
How long have you been there for me
I once was blind but now I see
A future full of hope
How I adore you
Repeat Chorus
Unlikely Angel
Oh, you never know where one might be
In sacred halls or crowded streets
But God has sent one straight down to me from heaven
Unlikely Angel
Unlikely Angel
Unlikely Angel
Unlikely Angel
Hmmmm
Whisper:
Unlikely Angel"
"Crazy crazy we'd have to be crazy to put up with the crazy things we do
Crazy crazy we'd have to be crazy but you know I'm crazy about you
Either I'm crazy or you are one or maybe it's me and you
For we'd have to be crazy to live like this and go through what we go through
Well our love's so strong but we can't get along there's never a minute of peace
If I ain't a querrellin' and a fussin' at you you're a querrellin' and a fussin' at me
Crazy crazy we'd have to be crazy...
Well we must love to live like this in our subconscious minds
How can you love somebody so much and despite 'em at the very same time
I guess our fightin's the only excitement we have in our life
Would you think all people could live like this we couldn't be too bright"
"I'm a little bit slow to catch on
When I do I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on
Well, I couldn't see the light for the brightness
Of the sweet little smile you gave me
I couldn't see how you were cheatin' on me
But finally I'm a catchin' on, on
Finally, I'm a' catchin' on
I'm a little bit slow to catch on
When I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on
I couldn't see the hurt for the happy
And at first that's the way you made me
It took me a while to get your style
But finally I'm a' catchin' on, on
Finally I'm a' catchin' on
I'm a little bit slow to catch on
When I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on
You say you can't see the light for the darkness
That surrounds you since I'm gone
You can't eat or sleep 'cause you're lonely
Well, finally you're catchin' on, on
Finally you're a' catchin' on
I'm a little bit slow to catch on
When I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on
I'm a little bit slow to catch on
When I do, I'm a caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on"
"(Dolly Parton)
When my strength is not enough to face the disapointments
When nothing seems to work out like I planned
When I think I've reached the end, just stop and reassure me
Cause I can make it, if you say I can
If you say I can, then I can find the strength to do it
In knowing you believe that much in me
Tell me that I can and give me faith in what I'm doing
I'm only just as strong as you make me
But I can do it, if you say I can
When I've reached the point of thinking life's not worth the bother
When I can't seem to give what life demands
When it seems impossible to make it any farther
I can go on, if you say I can
If you say I can, then I can find the strength to do it
In knowing you believe that much in me
Tell me that I can and give me faith in what I'm doing
I'm only just as strong as you make me
But I can do it, if you say I can"
"Please release me, let me go
'Cause I don't love you anymore
And to live without love is a sin
So release me and let me love again
I have found a new love, dear
And I'll always want him near
His lips are warm while yours are cold
So release me, my darlin' let me go
Oh please release me, let me go
'Cause I just won't love you anymore
And to live together we both know is a sin
So release me, release me and let me love again
Oh, please, please, please, please
Release me, let me go
'Cause I, I don't love you anymore
And to live together is a sin
So release me and let me love again"
"The gates and doors were barred
And all the windows fastened down
I spent the night in sleeplessness
And rose at every sound
Half in hope of sorrow
And half in fear the day
Would find the soldiers breakin' through
To drag us all away
And just before the sunrise
I heard something at the wall
The gate began to rattle
And a voice began to call
I hurried to the window
Looked down into the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldiers' feet
But there was no one there but Mary
So I went down to let her in
John stood there beside me
As she told me where she'd been
She said they've moved Him in the night
And none of us know where
The stone's been rolled away
And now His body isn't there
We both ran towards the garden
Then John ran on ahead
We found the stone and empty tomb
Just the way that Mary said
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in
Was just an empty shell
And how or where they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell
Oh something strange had happened there
Just what I did not know
John believed a miracle
But I just turned to go
Circumstance and speculation
Couldn't lift me very high
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him
Then I saw Him die
Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything I'd promised Him
Just added to my shame
When at last it came to choices
I denied I knew His name
And even if He was alive
It wouldn't be the same
But suddenly the air was filled
With a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from everywhere
Drove shadows from the room
And Jesus stood before me
With His arms held open wide
And I fell down on my knees
And I just clung to Him and cried
Then He raised me to my feet
And as I looked into His eyes
The love was shining out from Him
Like sunlight from the skies
Guilt in my confusion
Disappeared in sweet release
And every fear I ever had
Just melted into peace
He's alive yes He's alive
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive yes He's alive
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive
Hallelujah He's alive
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive He's alive
I believe it He's alive
Sweet Jesus"
"Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me!
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss-man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
An' the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5, whoa what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5, working 9 to 5"
"Soft as the voice of an angel, breathing a lesson unheard
Hope with a gentle persuasion whispers her comforting word
Wait till the darkness is over, wait till the tempest is gone
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow, after the shower is gone
Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice
Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice"
"I can hear the wind a blowin' in my mind
Just the way it use to sound through the Georgia pines
You were always there to answer when I'd call
You and me, we had it all
Remember how I use to touch your hair
Reaching for the feeling that was always there
You were the best thing in my life, I can recall
You and me, we had it all
I know that we can never live those times again
But I let my dreams take me back to where we've been
And I stay there with you just as long as I can
Oh it was so good
It was so good
It was so good when you were my man
But I'll never stop believing in your smile
Even though you didn't stay, it was all worth while
You were the best thing in my life I can recall
You and me, we had it all
I know that we could never get that far again
So I let these memories take me on back to where we've been
And I stay there with you just as long as I can
Oh it was so good, it really was
It was so good, oh oh
It was so good when you were my man
You were the best thing in my life I can recall
You and me, we had it all"
"I couldn't wait forever
Did you expect me to
I guess you thought I'd never
Find somebody new
I lived on dreams and promises
As long as I could
I couldn't wait forever
The way you thought I would
The lonely nights grew longer
As I prayed for time to fly
I lived on hopes that you'd return
And that's how I got by
The agony of loneliness
Just got too much for me
I couldn't wait forever
Needing love so desperately
So I found new lips to kiss me
New arms to hold me tight
I found new love and happiness
To fill these empty nights
You took my love for granted
Now my heart has found a new home
I couldn't wait forever
Forever's just too long
I couldn't wait forever
Forever's just too long"
"(Floyd Parton)
I'll do everything I can to make you proud to be my man
And I'll fulfill all your fantasies
I guess we're promising a lot, but for now it's all we've got
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years
Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
Side by side we'll be together always
And if you'll hold me tight when you love me
That's all I'll ask of you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years
I'll be your friend, I'll be your lover
Until the end, there'll be no other
'Cause my heart has only room for one
Yes, I'll always love you, and I'll always be here for you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years
Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
Side by side we'll be together always
And if you'll hold me tight when you love me
That's all I'll ask of you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years
Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
Side by side, we'll be together always
And, yes, I'll always love you and I'll always be here for you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years, and I'll be here
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years
Through our rockin' years"
"(Dolly Parton)
The word ""If"", just two tiny letters
Says so much for something so small
The biggest little word in existence;
Never answers, just questions us all
If regrets were gold, I'd be rich as a queen
If teardrops were diamonds, how my face would gleam
If I'd loved you better, I wouldn't be lonely
If only, if only, if only
But looking back now I see clearly
With my twenty-twenty hindsight
Oh, but don't think I haven't paid dearly,
'Cause you could be in my arms tonight
If regrets were gold, I'd be rich as a queen
If teardrops were diamonds, how my face would gleam
How I let you go, I swear is beyond me
But if only; ah, if only; oh, if only
I could start over, if I could go back
Have the power to change things
Then I would do that
But I listened to others like a fool,
Oh, shame on me
But if only you would just come back
If only, dare I even ask
Oh, if only"
"Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as goneI stand here in the doorway of the room where you lie sleeping
In hopes that I don't wake you up with the sounds of my weeping
It breaks my heart to see you laying there
Alone in the bed we used to share
'Cause you no longer want me and I wonder what went wrong
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone
There's so much more between us than just these lonely walls
The echoes of our dying love lingers in the halls
Living separately together in a house that's not a home
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone
Through the eyes of a broken heart, I watch my whole world fall apart
I'm trying to revive a love that's died
Hopelessly I'm holding on to a love I know is gone
Gone, but not because I haven't tried
Disappearing from your door way now the hurt is twice as strong"
"I've been around for you, been up and down for you
But I just can't get any relief
I swallowed my pride for you, I've lived and lied for you
But you still make me feel like a thief
You've got me stealing your love away, 'cause you never give it
Peeling the years away, we can't relive it
I make you laugh and you make me cry, I believe it's time for me to fly
Time for me to fly, got to set myself free
That's how it's got to be
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly
You said we'd work it out, you said that you had no doubt
I thought we were really in love
Oh but I'm tired of holding on to a feeling I know is gone
I do believe I've had enough
I've had enough of the falseness of a worn out relation
Enough of this jealousy and intoleration
I wonder why I even try, I believe it's time for me to fly
Time for me to fly, I've got to set myself free
That's just how it's got to be
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly, time for me to fly
Time for me to fly, I've got to set myself free
That's just how it's got to be
I make you laugh and you make me cry
I believe it's time for me to fly
Time for me to fly
That's how it's got to be
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But it's time for me to fly"
"Tonight i feel a chill in the air
As cold as that look on your face
I hear what you're saying but coming from you
Goodbye seems so out of place
Now how can you stand there and honestly say
There never wee any real promises made
[Chorus]
The moon is my witness
The stars will agree
They all heard you promise
You'd always love me
I know that it's true
But it's hard to believe
You lied to the moon
The stars and me
And what about all of those warm tender nights
Did they mean nothing to you
And where are the feelings i thought that we shared
Or have you forgotten them too
Did you think i could just put your memory behind
When your words are still so very clear in my mind
[Chorus:Repeat x2]"
"Somewhere along the way we drifted apart
As we walked the road of love we lost our way
Now it's too late to start all over for there's no turning back
We lost each other somewhere along the way
Somewhere along the way we neglected one another
Our careless steps have led us to the end
Oh and all we can do now is just feel sorry for each other
Cause once love has died it won't ever live again
Somewhere along the way hey hey we stumbled oh and we fail
Love is not a game for fools to play
We both played and we both lost now we're both sorry and both to fault
We lost that love somewhere along the way"
"(Dolly Parton)
The man I loved ran a salesman route
Selling goods from house to house
Now I knew my mama would never stand
For me stepping out with no traveling man
Mama bought things that he was a'selling
But mama didn't know and I sure wasn't telling
That behind her back I was making plans
To meet somewhere with that traveling man
Oh the traveling man was a good bit older
But a girl needs arms to hold her
Mama didn't know 'cause I didn't told her
But mama wouldn't understand
Me stepping out with a traveling man
Mama didn't allow me a'going courting
And I'd tell lies that I reckon I oughtn't
Oh but she'd a'give me the back a' her hand
If she'd a'seen me with that traveling man
So I tell my mama that I reckon I oughta
Go to the spring and fetch us some water
What mama didn't know is I had a plan
To meet down there with that traveling man
Now I make plans to run away
With that traveling man on a Saturday
Well Saturday's here and here I stand
And there goes my mama with that traveling man
Oh that traveling man was a two-time lover
He took my love then he took my mother
But I didn't know 'cause mama didn't told me and I don't understand
My mama running off with my traveling man
Mama, you know you oughtn't a'done that
You just like my daddy
He run off before I ever knowed him
You done run-off with my traveling man
And I really don't think I ever knowed you either
Oh there goes my mama with my traveling man
And I'm really gonna miss that traveling man
Mm-hm"
"Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again
What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
I guess I should have known the worst was yet to come
And the crying time for me had just begun
Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again
Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
And then today I started loving you again"
"Look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
Hey, look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
It's the Orange Blossom Special
Bringin' my baby back
Well, I'm going down to Florida
And get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californy
And get some sand in my shoes
I'll ride that Orange Blossom Special
And lose these New York blues
""Say man, when you going back to Florida?""
""When am I goin' back to Florida? I don't know, don't reckon I ever will.""
""Ain't you worried about getting your nourishment in New York?""
""Well, I don't care if I do-die-do-die-do-die-do-die.""
Hey talk about a-ramblin'
She's the fastest train on the line
Talk about a-travellin'
She's the fastest train on the line
It's that Orange Blossom Special
Rollin' down the seaboard line"
"Ah, now I don't hardly know her
But I think I could love her
Crimson and clover
Ah when she comes walking over
Now I've been waitin' to show her
Crimson and clover over and over
Yeah, my, my such a sweet thing
I wanna do everything
What a beautiful feeling
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over
Crimson and clover over and over"
"Trouble, we have known trouble
In our struggle just to get by
Many times the burden's been heavy
Still we carried on side by side
[Chorus]
And when we're gone long gone
The only thing that will have mattered
Is the love that we shared
And the way that we cared
When we're gone, long gone
And when we're walking together in glory
Hand in hand through eternity
It's the love that will be remembered
Not wealth, not poverty
[Chorus]"
"(Dolly Parton)
Stand back, and give me room
And listen to that beat
I got the music in my soul
And the rhythm in my feet
When I hear the music
You won't catch me standing still
And I won't miss a beat
I never have and I never will
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
I can dance to anything
That any band can play
I've got old-fashioned values
But I'm pretty up to date
And I know all the latest hits
On the radio
You don't have to join me
Stand back and watch my show
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
Thought I couldn't dance
Hey, watch me prance
Let's make romance
Thought I couldn't dance
You gotta take a chance
If you're gonna learn to dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
There's a lot of closet dancers
Just dyin' to come out
They dance alone inside their rooms
With the music way up loud
And I know you thought I couldn't dance
But I guess I sure fooled you
It just goes to show you never know
Who's wearing dancin' shoes
And you thought I couldn't dance
I'm full of surprises
And you thought I couldn't dance
It's too late now
I can't slow down...can't slow down
Oh, feel the heat
From these dancin' feet... can't slow down
And you thought I couldn't dance
And you thought I couldn't dance
Repeat..."
"(Dolly Parton)
I have rocked you to sleep like a baby
Stood beneath you and lifted you up
I have given you comfort and safety
Now you've gone in the prime of our love
I have cradled your head on my pillow
Quenched your thirst from my sweet loving cup
I have bowed to your needs like a willow
Now you've gone in the prime of our love
Oh, the days are slow in their passing
And the nights are so dreadfully dull
And the question my heart keeps on asking
Why'd you leave in the prime of our love?
I have cradled your head on my pillow
Quenched your thirst from my sweet loving cup
I have bowed to your needs like a willow
Now you've gone in the prime of our love
In the prime of our love you've forsaken
Our bright hopes and just left them to fade
And the heart that was yours for the breaking
Lies in pieces to wither away
I have cradled your head on my pillow
Quenched your thirst from my sweet loving cup
I have bowed to your needs like a willow
Now you've gone in the prime of our love
In the prime of our love you've forsaken
Our bright hopes and just left them to fade
And the heart that was yours for the breaking
Lies in pieces to wither away
Lies in pieces as cold as the clay"
"(Dolly Parton)
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
Just because it feels right does not make it so
So we struggle through life in horns and halos
Tempted and tried with each step we take
We stumble and slide and make our mistakes,
Ask God to forgive us for all of our sins,
Then we take off our horns and wear halos again
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
Just because it feels right does not make it so
So we struggle through life in horns and halos
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
We're praised or we're scorned, we either run or we faint
Oh, but life is a challenge from the day that we're born
Just tryin' to balance halos and horns
It's heaven or hell, halos or horns
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
But just because it feels right; well, that don't make it so
So we struggle through life in horns or halos
It's either horns or halos"
"It's good to be back home again at the Sevier Tennessee
I'm awful glad to see you hope you're glad to see me
Now I'd like to say I love you I welcome to you all
Now I know I stole this steam from the Wabash Cannonball
From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
Up the hills and down the mountains and the valleys to the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome and known quite well by all
She's a mighty famous thing called the Wabash Cannonball (Pete Drake)
[ steel - fiddle ]
Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
That's that train from Tennessee boys she's long and she's tall
She's a famous choo-choo train called the Wabash Cannonball (yodel)"
"(Dolly Parton)
Oh look at you boy, look at them jeans
Cutest little buttfull I've ever seen
I'd like to find you under my tree
Whatcha tryin' to do to me, huh?
Hey look at them boots, look at that hat
You can get in big trouble lookin' like that
Flirtin' like mad, talkin' that trash
You could make a good girl go bad real fast
Chorus:
Whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do anyhow
I ain't made of steel but if looks could kill
Well I'd 've been dead by now
Tell me whatcha tryin to do to me
Look at that smile, look at them eyes
All lit up like Christmas lights
When you land on my roof tonight
Well here's what you better be
Well you'd better be fit, you'd better be prime
Cause I'm gonna ring your Christmas chime
When you climb down my chimney
Do whatcha you know only you can do to me
Repeat Chorus
I said ooh, what a thrill but if looks could kill
Well I'd 've been dead by now
Tell me whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do
Whatcha tryin' to do to me"
"Baby, won't you come out tonight
Just come up the hill 'cause there's a full moon on the risin'
Hey baby, can't you steal away
You know I really need to see you tonight
I just got word you was packin' it in
What's the matter, this old town got you crazy again
I can see the sad look in your eyes
But I don't know how to say goodbye
And tomorrow, you're gonna have your day
Take your wife and you're gonna run away
Baby, while I'm wailin'
You'll be sailin' like a hog across the bay singin'
Ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Baby, won't you come out tonight
Oh baby, won't you come out tonight
We'll run up the hill and we'll dance in the moonlight
Let me gaze into your eyes 'til we both go blind
Oh baby, can I see you tonight
I'm just tryin' to find a way to make it last
Good friends, they seem to slip away so fast
An' I know we're both headed down separate tracks
An' when ya' go, baby don't look back
There won't be no more sleepin' over on a Tuesday night
No more runnin' to the races for a dark horse at midnight
No more dancin' after hours, singin' in the showers
Or clingin' to each other in the soft mornin' light singin'
Ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
I'll meet ya' on the corner
And you'll be there at midnight
Oh baby, can you steal away
You know I really want to see ya' tonight
Ooo baby, can you come out tonight
We'll run up the hill and dance again in the moonlight
Oh baby, can you steal away
I really wanna see you tonight
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
Come up the hill, there's a full moon on the rise
Oh baby, can ya' steal away
Baby, won't ya' come out tonight"
"There is a house down in New Orleans
Down in the Vieux Carr'e
A house they call the rising sun
Where love and money are made
My father he was a gambler
Mother died when I was young
And I've worked since then
To please the men
At the house of the rising sun
There is a house
Down in New Orleans
They call the rising sun
It's been the ruin of many a good girl
And oh God, you know I'm one
So mothers you go telling all your daughters
Not to do what I've done
To live a life of sin, shame and strife
In the house of the rising sun"
"Duet with Porter Wagoner
Writer Tom T. Hall
Copyright 1967
The first strange town I was ever in the county was hangin' a man
And nobody cared if he lived or he died and I just didn't understand
So I washed my face in the morning dew bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew and kept on moving along
The second strange town I was in they were laughing at a poor crippled man
Begging for nickels and dimes on the street and I just didn't understand
So I washed my face...
The third strange town that I was in was settled peaceful and nice
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer and to me it didn't seem right
So I washed my face...
Now someday times are bound to change it can't be very far
And each injustice that I have seen will come before the bar
Then I'll wash my face in the morning dew bathe my soul in the sun
Wash my face in the morning dew and my journey will be done"
"What good is wealth and fame
Fine clothes and diamond rings
It just don't mean a thing if you aint got love
Big homes and fancy cars
Rubbing elbows with the stars
It just wont get you far if you aint got love
Well you can have your cake and icing too
If you got someone to love who cares for you
Cause loves the sweetest gift we can possess
To have true love is to be truly blessed
What good is wealth and fame
Fine clothes and diamond rings
It just don't mean a thing if you aint got love
Big homes and fancy cars
Rubbing elbows with the stars
It just wont get you far if you aint got love
Cause love and happiness and piece of mind
Its what we all desire but never find
Cause nothing in this world can take its place
Lets fill our hearts with love for goodness sake
What good is wealth and fame
Fine clothes and diamond rings
It just don't mean a thing if you aint got love
Big homes and fancy cars
Rubbing elbows with the stars
It just wont get you far if you aint got love
Cause if you aint got love
If you aint got love
If you aint got love
If you aint got love
Baby if you aint got love
Your outta touch you aint got enough if you aint got love
Your outta touch you aint got enough if you aint got love"
"Like the weather your heart changes with each season
Springtime summer fall and winter too
Though I know I'll never understand the reason
I still wonder why each season changes you
It was springtime when I found you like the flowers
And our love grew warmer with the summer sun
In the fall I could see our love was changing
It broke my heart to see what wintertime had done
Like the weather your heart changes...
[Trumpet]
Came the spring again you said that you were sorry
And the summer brought a golden memory
In the fall I saw your love was changing
And the winter brought the same old misery
Like the weather your heart changes..."
"(Porter Wagoner)
If I cross your mind, please let me cross it slowly
Let me stop and reminisce with you for a while
And if I cross your mind, please remember only good things
Think of me as happiness if I cross your mind
There must be a million thoughts rushing through your mind
And if there's one of me love, among them that you find
Please stop for just a little while and treat it extra kind
When you think of me love, if I cross your mind
If you must hide my memory when you're with someone else
Then make mine very special when you're by yourself
For only in a memory can one turn back the time
To lovely tender moments that linger in your mind
There must be a million thoughts rushing through your mind
And if there's one of me love, among them that you find
Won't you stop for just a little while and treat it extra kind
When you think of me love, if I cross your mind
Think of only good things if I cross your mind"
"In the airport lounge he sat with his cane and derby hat
The grandest man that I had ever seen
Outside the heavy rains had grounded all the planes
So I asked him if he'd like some company
In my rhinestone-studded suit and my cowgirl high-heel boots
I must have been a site for him to see
But he said, ""Pull up a chair"", as I fumbled with my hair
A more unlikely pair you'll never see
I was Mogan David wine, he was Chablis fifty-nine
But there we sat, the cowgirl and the dandy
He was ski resorts in Aspen and summers in Paris
I was Grand Ole Opry, Nashville, Tennessee
The cowgirl and the dandy as different as can be
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee
Then somewhere in between, his Harvey's Bristol cream
And the beer that I kept sippin' at his table
We somehow came together for a night of stormy weather
Now there's a little bit of class in this old cabin
An' there's a little bit of country in the dandy
Cowgirl and the dandy as different as can be
But it seemed so right that rainy night in Tennessee
I was Mogan David wine, he was Chablis fifty-nine
But there we sat, the cowgirl and the dandy
He was ski resorts in Aspen and summers in Paris
I was Grand Ole Opry, Nashville, Tennessee
He was ski resorts in Aspen and summers in Paris
I was Grand Ole Opry, Nashville, Tennessee"
"Well, I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
Saying something about a queen
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at mother nature on the run
In the twentieth century
Look at mother nature on the run
In the twentieth century
I was lying in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eye
I was hoping for replacement
When the sun burst through the sky
There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like I could cry
I was thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There was children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream, the loading had begun
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home"
"(Dolly Parton)
We once were so close now the love light
That glowed has now gone out of our eyes
And the good life we had for some reason went bad
And the love that once lived here has died
How did we get here, where did it start
When did we walk out of each other's hearts
Where did we lose it, how did love die
When, where, and how, but most of all why
Most of all, why did we let love die
Like the withering leaves in the fall
And why did we wait 'til it was to late
To realize how much we lost
How did we get here, where did it start
When did we walk out of each other's hearts
Where did we lose it, how did love die
When, where, and how, but most of all why"
"They say a woman's a fool for weeping
A fool to break her own heart
But I can't hold the secret I'm keeping
I'm breaking apart
Can't seem to mind my own business
Whatever I try turns out wrong
I seem like my own false witness
And I can't go on
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies
You told me you needed my company
And I believed in your flattering ways
You told me you needed me forever
Nearly gave you the rest of my days
Should've seen you for what you are
Should never have come back for more
Should've locked up all my silver
Brought the key right to your door
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies
You don't know what a chance is
Until you have to seize one
You don't know what a man is
Until you have to please one
Don't put your life in the hands of a man
With a face for every season
Don't waste your time in the arms of a man
Who's no stranger to treason
I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies"
"We've been a searching for the love that lost its feeling
That one time filled our hearts with fire with love revealing
We thought that love had gone never more to be returning
And the fire that we thought had gone out again is brightly burning
Oh we found it oh we found it yes we found it yeah we found it
Joy to love joy to love we found it
And the lights are way down low the fire of love is high
We found it yes we found it oh we found it oh we found it
Sweet love you and I
[ steel ]
Well I never seen a lovelight shine so bright no wonder we found it
Shining like a neon light with love all around it
It's nights like this with love's sweet bliss sprinkled all around it
We cried a while but now we smile hmm hmm we found it
Oh we found it oh we found...
Oh we found it oh we found..."

"Welcome to Love City population two
It isn't a big place our little town
But it's filled with lovely sights all around
A park filled with flowers a beautiful lawn
The streets of the driveway that leads to our home
Just a small house on an acre of ground
We call it Love City our little town
Welcome to Love City polulation two
Founded on a little love that just grew and grew
Between me and you
We built our home on Love's Avenue
The taxes are low and it has a nice view
We've got home cooked meals that are fit for a king
And all kinds of love to fill every dream
A room just for friends if they happen to
Visit our Love City population two"
"We don't take away one happy moment
We won't take away any of the new
We'll do anything to make each other happy
Love is give and take but we don't take away
I never thought that love could make you feel so happy
I thought I'd found love once but I wasn't even close not even close
Well you make me want to call you sweet names at the waking of each day
For each day I love you more and we won't ever take away
We don't take away one happy moment...
Love is give and take but we don't take away take away"

I am ready
Oh, my children
When Jesus knocks at my door
I'll be there come morning
Don't weep for me
I'll be with my Lord
There's my bible on the table
Read it to me once more
I can hear God's heavenly angels
Singing me on through heaven's door
Hallelujah Lord
I am ready
No more sorrow
Hallelujah, yes
I am ready, I am ready
I am ready to go"
"(Dolly Parton)
You say that you're bored with life and that you're bored with me
'Cause you say that this love of ours ain't what it ought to be
Now you despise this little house that we've always called home
I know that you don't love me now, but you'll love me when I'm gone
Gone
You'll love me when I'm gone and then you'll realize just what I meant to you
You-oo-oo-oo
You'll miss me when I'm gone and then you'll realize how good I've been to you
You-ooo-ooo-ooo
You'll want me when I'm gone and then you'll realize you've loved me all along
Oh, it's true you may not love me now, but you'll love me when I'm gone
Gone
We've grown too familiar with each other, so you say
You say there's no excitement now. Too bad you feel that way
Well, I wonder how exciting that your life will be alone
Oh, I know you may not want me now, but you'll miss me when I'm gone
Gone
You'll love me when I'm gone and then you'll realize just what I meant to you
You-oo-oo-oo
You'll miss me when I'm gone and then you'll realize how good I've been to you
You-ooo-ooo-ooo
You'll want me when I'm gone and then you'll realize you've loved me all along
Oh, I know you may not want me now, but you'll miss me when I'm gone

"Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, You know I need someone
Help
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never thought I needed any help in any way
Now that these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured
And now I find I changed my mind, opened up the door, so
Help me if You can, I'm feelin' down
And I do appreciate You bein' 'round, You know I do
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't You please, please help me, help me, help me?"
"Where you live you say the view is so beautiful
And the astroturf that's on your lawn stays green the whole year around
And the buildings are so tall they almost reach heaven
But do you ever ever hear the robins sing
Do you hear the robins singing in the springtime
While a mockingbird sings his happy song
Is all the beauty in your world this artificial thing
Do you ever ever hear the robins sing
[ ac.guitar ]
Where I live the butterflies still kiss the roses
And forgetmenots still grow along the shady lane
And the weeping willow trees still swaying in the breeze
And often I still hear the robins sing
Do you hear the robins...
Do you ever ever hear the robins sing"
"You got a snazzy new car in your driveway
And expensive new clothes on your back
Every short skirt on the highway
Has spent time in your bachelor pad
We dance and you look over my shoulder
And make eyes at somebody else
You swear that you're not, but you know that's a croc
Cause you only care for yourself
Your attitude stinks and I hate it
You're arrogant, cocky and rude
You're selfish, conceited and jaded
Everything's all about you
You think that I'm lucky to have you
You think you're so handsome, so what
I'm callin' you out cause I don't need this crap
I'm gettin' myself outta dodge
Cause you don't know love from shinola
With you love is not what I found
A woman needs someone to hold her
Not someone to just lay her down
I want someone I can count on
A cool headed, warm hearted shoulder
To cry on, rely on, today and from now on
But you don't know love from shinola
You don't know love
From shinola
Oh but I gave you love and affection
But you never gave one iota
It was an early detection
That you don't know love from shinola
You don't know love from shinola
You don't know what true loves about
Well you'll find your world growin' colder
When you're alone and without
So go on, lover boy, have a big time
Drink up on your bourbon and cola
When you sober up you'll be *beep* outta luck
Cause you don't know love from shinola
I'm in it for love, but you're just plain stuck
You don't know love from shinola"
"(Billy Joel)
Hey Lord, take a look on around tonight
And find out where my baby's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For he is far away from me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
Make sure that he's gonna be alright
Things gonna be alright with me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
And make sure all his dreams are sweet
Send down that ya got him on the road
But you'll make it softer for his feet
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
Make sure that he's gonna be alright
'Til he's home and here with me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For he is sleeping under the sky
Hey Lord, make sure the ground he's sleepin' on
Is always warm and dry
Ooo, don't give him too much pain
And keep him away from planes
Cause my baby hates to fly
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For it gets rough along the way
And if it all sounds strange
Just because I don't know how to pray
Ooo, won't you give him peace of mind
And if you ever find the time
Tell him I miss him everyday
Hey Lord, take a look on around tonight
And find out where he's gonna be
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
For he is far away from me
Hey Lord, would ya look out for him tonight
Make sure that he's gonna be alright
'Til he's home and here with me
Here with me"
"Today as I was walking
In the fields just down the way
I sat down on a fallen log
To pass the time away
And as I looked around me
The more that I did look
The more I realize that I am viewing
God's coloring book
I saw a golden ray of sunlight
A silver drop of dew
A soft, white floating cloud
Sailing cross the sky 'a blue
A yellow dandelion
Pretty evergreen
And some red and orange flowers
Growing wild along the stream
And the more I look around me
And the more that I do look
The more I realize that I am viewing
God's coloring book
The greyness in an old man's hair
The pink in baby's cheeks
The blackness in a stormy sky
The brown in fallen leaves
And the multicolored rainbow
Stretched out across the sky
And the purple haze at sunset
Just before the night
And the more I look around me
And the more that I do look
The more I realize that I am viewing
God's coloring book
Then I turn my face toward the sky
And say a silent prayer
Though God doesn't speak to me
I see him everywhere
He is all around me
He's everywhere I look
And each new day is but a new page
In god's coloring book
Tag:
Each new day is but a new page
In god's coloring book
Hmmmmmm"
"I just want to be somebody's everything.
You say I've seen too many movies, watched too much TV,
Read too many fairy tales that I live and make believe.
You say the kind of love I'm dreamin' of does not exist.
And there's no one like I'm searchin' for, well, I believe there is.
And I want someone to come alive when they lay eyes on me,
Have a lust within their touch, a passion fire beyond belief.
Reality and fantasy should be one in the same
And I want to be somebody's everything.
I refuse to settle for something less than great.
And if it takes a lifetime, then that's how long I'll wait.
'Cause all I want is everything, is that too much to ask?
Have romance, love and passion; find magic that will last.
And I want someone to think they'll die if they can't be with me.
I want to be their joy, their pride, their dreams,
The very air they breathe.
I want to wake up feelin' loved and go to bed the same.
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything, somebody's everything.
Oh, I want someone to come alive when they lay eyes on me.
Have a lust within their touch, a passion fire beyond belief.
I'd love to wake up feelin' loved and go to bed the same.
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything.
Someone to hold me close and tremble when the lovin's done.
Think it's heaven, call me angel, think I hung the moon and sun.
Get misty eyed just knowin' with a love song people sing.
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything.
And I'm gonna be somebody's everything,
somebody's everything.
I want to be, I'm gonna be somebody's everything.
I want to be, I want to be somebody's everything,
Somebody's everything, somebody's everything
Somebody's everything, somebody's everything
Yes I want to be, I'm gonna be somebody's everything
I want to be, I'm gonna be, I wanna be somebody's everything"
"(Dolly Parton)
Without a love to call my own my life was incomplete
It seems I couldn't help but think that love was not for me
But my life took on a different twist when I met me a man that I couldn't resist
I didn't know what all I'd missed, and I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy
Yeah, I'm a gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone
I got someone to call my own and now my life is like a song
And he helps me sing along - I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, people used to talk of love and I couldn't understand
About the fire and the desire in lovin' a good man
Oh, but now I know just what they meant since I met me a man that was Heaven sent
Wonder where the sadness went, cause I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy
I'm a gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone
I got someone to call my own and now my life is like a song
And he helps me sing along - an' I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy - whoo!
Yeah, I'm gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone
I got someone to call my own, now my life is like a song
Got someone to sing along and I'm a gettin' happy
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy
Hey, hey I'm a gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone
'Cause I'm a gettin' happy"
"Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you
But I hope it ain't for long
And I wonder if you're even gonna notice that I'm gone
Oh it hurts to know you cheated
And it hurt to know you lied
But it hurts me even worse to know you never even tried
I packed my suitcase full of heartaches
Headin' for the train depot
And I bought a one-way ticket
On that train they call Blue Smoke
I left the station straight-up midnight
Feelin' lonely, lost and blue
In a trail of blue smoke with my heart broke
Said good-bye to you
Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train

"I don't want to hear a love song
I got on this airplane just to fly
I know there's life below me
And all that you can show me is the prairie and the sky
I don't want to hear a sad story filled with heartbreak and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness and the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain in the night
And I watched it burn, I watched it burn, I watched it burn
I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in a saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, see your face
Well you really got me this time
And the hardest part is knowing I survive
And I've come to listen to the sounds of trucks
As they moved out on Highway 95
And pretending it's the ocean coming to wash me clear
To wash me clear if you know what I mean
I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in a saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, see your face"

I'm awful glad to see you hope you're glad to see me

From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
Up the hills and down the mountains and the valleys to the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome and known quite well by all
She's a mighty famous thing called the Wabash Cannonball (Pete Drake)
[ steel - fiddle ]
Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
That's that train from Tennessee boys she's long and she's tall
She's a famous choo-choo train called the Wabash Cannonball (yodel)"
"I met a man in Texas
And oh, he was so fine
And I said to myself
Self, I'm gonna make him mine
He owned a lot of oil wells and his bank roll sure was healthy
And I new if I married him I'd suddenly be wealthy
Oh I'll oil wells love you
I'll oil wells care
I'll oil wells need you
I want you oil wells dear
Well I never had no money
Not a penny to my name
And I said I'd find a rich man
And I'd love my way to fame
So he took mt in his arms
And I cuddled up real near
The money bug then bit me and I wispered in his ear
Oh, I'll oil wells love you
I'll oil wells care
I'll oil wells need you
I want you oil wells dear
He looked in to my eyes and thought he saw a love light shine
Nearly did he know that that light was dollar signs
Now that we are married there ain't nothin' left to tell
We'll live happily ever after because all is well that ends well"
"(Dolly Parton)
I look at you and I see something special
I feel something special, something that's rare
If you feel the same way when you're lookin' at me
I know there could be a love we could share
Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the things that we need
Won't you come and love with me
We'll sing us a love song the songbirds would envy
A song that the angels would be proud to sing
We'll say with our hearts what no poet could capture
Say with our eyes what no artist could paint
Won't you come and love with me
Shelter your love in my castle of dreams
We'll find in each other the love that we need
Won't you come and love with me"
"Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from nine to five
Workin' nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me!
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss-man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
An' the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way
Workin' nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
Nine to five, whoa what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet"
"I can hear the wind a blowin' in my mind
Just the way it use to sound through the Georgia pines
You were always there to answer when I'd call
You and me, we had it all
Remember how I use to touch your hair
Reaching for the feeling that was always there
You were the best thing in my life, I can recall
You and me, we had it all
I know that we can never live those times again
But I let my dreams take me back to where we've been
And I stay there with you just as long as I can
Oh it was so good
It was so good
It was so good when you were my man
But I'll never stop believing in your smile
Even though you didn't stay, it was all worth while
You were the best thing in my life I can recall
You and me, we had it all
I know that we could never get that far again
So I let these memories take me on back to where we've been
And I stay there with you just as long as I can
Oh it was so good, it really was
It was so good, oh oh
It was so good when you were my man
You were the best thing in my life I can recall
You and me, we had it all"
"(Dolly Parton)
Up on Sugar Hill we'd go walkin'
Hand in hand while the south wind blowed
Bob whites callin', black crows cawkin',
Countin' the warts on a toad in the road
Down in the mill pond swimmin' naked
Showin' more than we should have showed
We were just kids explorin' nature
Learnin' more than we should have knowed
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill memories
Stealing sugar on the mountainside
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill sugar
Sweeter than candy and cake and pie
A yellow dress drapin' off of my shoulder
Seein' myself in the lookin' glass
Older now and a little bit bolder
Thinkin' about our summers past
Up on Sugar Hill we'd go walkin'
Hand in hand up the mountainside
Teenage lovers plannin' and talkin'
Dreamin' of a future for you and I
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill memories
Stealin' sugar on the mountain top
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill sugar
Sweeter than ice cream and soda pop
Years have past, we're married with children
Our days are happy and our memories fond
We still find it quite appealin'
To go to Sugar Hill and swim naked in the pond
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill memories
Stealin' sugar on the mountaintop
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill sugar
Sweeter than ice cream and soda pop
Up on Sugar Hill there's a wealth of treasure
Down it's memory lane I go walking still
What it means to me is more than I can measure
Golden moments up on Sugar Hill
Up on Sugar Hill with the fireflies glowin'
Sound of katydids and the whipperwill
Honeysuckle bloomin' and a mountain stream flowin'
A little spot of heaven up on Sugar Hill
Up On Sugar Hill with the bobwhite's callin'
Black crows cawkin', and the soft wind blows
Up on Sugar Hill there are love birds talkin'
Up on Sugar Hill where the good times roll
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill memories
Stealin' sugar on the mountainside
Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill sugar
Sweeter than candy and cakes and pies
A little spot of heaven up on Sugar Hill"
"(Dolly Parton)
Fly away from my window little blue bird
Fly as far as you can away from here
And let not your song fall upon my ear
Go spread your blue wings and I'll shed my blue tears
For the one that I have loved
He has left me and gone
An' I'm in no mood for to hear your sad song
Bring not your light into my dark room, yellow sunshine
Waste not your warmth on the cold glisten here
Oh, trouble me not
Go ye elsewhere
Go light your blue sky and I'll shed my blue tears
For the only one that I have ever loved has gone away
An' I'm in no mood for the sunshine today"
"(Dolly Parton)
I didn't cry all of these tears just to have you show up here again
I didn't lie awake all these nights to have you come walking back in
I didn't change my whole life around, not to mention my dreams and my plans
To have you come back with your same ol' act thinking that I'll understand
Time and tears have mended the pain
Healed all the hurt and changed everything
Time and tears I'm happy to say
Time and tears have washed it away
Time and tears have washed you away
I didn't think that I would survive the day that you walked out on me
I truly was more dead than alive; and the pain, Lord I couldn't believe
I asked God to please have mercy on me and to ease all the feelings I felt
Then I saw the light, now I'm more than alright;
I'm much better off since you left
Time and tears have mended the pain
Healed all the hurt and changed everything
Time and tears have carried me through
Time and tears got me over you
Time and tears and somebody new
Time and tears is all that it takes
To mend shattered hopes or a heart when it breaks
Time and tears have carried me through
Time and tears got me over you
Time and tears and somebody new
Time and tears, time and tears got me over you
Time and tears, got me over you"
"I flew off to the wild blue yonder
'Cause I had a dream
And I had to go
But I'm filled with a sense of wonder
From the love I shared
With a green-eyed boy
Lips as sweet as mountain honey
A body warm as home made wine
But he had no dreams
And no means for money
But he had me just anytime
Take me back, If just in memory
Fill my cup again with joy
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy
Now he was pretty
With chiseled features
Like the movie stars in the magazines
My first love and the son of a preacher
I fantasized me was James Dean
But the world outside kept pulling at me
Offered me fame, respect, and gold
Designer clothes and a fancy mansion
Expensive cars, so I chose those
Take me back, If just in memory
Fill my cup again with joy
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy
Take me back, If just in memory
Fill my cup again with joy
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy
Ooh, ooh, how I love that green-eyed boy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, and I still miss
That green-eyed boy
Do you think about me
When the nights are long and cold
Do you ever miss me
Do you my green-eyed boy"
"My heart beats - wild and deep
Every thought in my mind has your name on it
Hard to breathe - I can't speak
Think of your love and just how much I want it
Chorus:
When I'm touching you - I feel a sudden change
When I'm kissing you - I taste the sun and rain
When I look at you - I hear the angels sing
And when I'm holding you... I'm holding everything
Everything that's mine to give
Everything I can do - I'll do to prove it
For as long (for as long)
As I may live (as I may live)
My love will be there for you to use it
Chorus
Everything - I'm holding everything
When I'm touching you - I'm touching everything
When I'm kissing you - I'm kissing everything
Everything (everything) uh huh
My heart beats - wild and deep
Every thought in my mind has your name on it
It's hard to breathe (it's hard to breathe)
And I can't speak (I can't speak)
Think of your love and just how bad I - want it
And when you're touching me - I feel a sudden change
When you're kissing me - I taste the sun and rain
And when I look at you - I hear the angels sing
You're everything (everything)
I'm holding everything (everything)
Everything (you're everything)
You're everything (everything to me)
Everything (everything)
You're everything"
"We'd get up before sun-up to get the work done up
We'd work in the fields till the sun had gone down
We've stood and we've cried as we have bristly watched
A hailstorm a' beatin' our crops to the ground
We've gone to bed hungry many nights in the past
In the good old days when times were bad
No amount of money could buy from me
The memories that I have of then
No amount of money could pay me
To go back and live through it again
I've seen daddy's hands break open and bleed
And I've seen him work till he's stiff as a board
An' I've seen momma layin' in suffer and sickness
In need of a doctor we couldn't afford
Anything at all was more than we had
In the good old days when times were bad
We've got up before and found ice on the floor
Where the wind would blow snow through the cracks in the wall
And I couldn't enjoy then, havin' a boyfriend
I had nothing decent to wear at all
So I long for a love that I never had
In the good old days when times were bad
No amount of money could buy from me
The memories that I have of then
No amount of money could pay me
To go back and live through it again
In the good old days when times were bad
In the good old days when times were bad"
"You're the one that puts the sparkle in my eyes
You're the one that puts the laughter in my smile
You're the one that puts the meaning in my life
And I'm bubbling over, bubbling over, bubbling over
Because you are mine
Bubbling over with the joy that only love can bring
Bubbling over with the song you taught my heart to sing
And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone can see
That I'm bubbling over, bubbling over, bubbling over
Because you love me
I have never known a love that felt like this
You're the one I want to share my lovin' with
Your gentle way of lovin' me and your thoughtfulness
Keeps me bubbling over, bubbling over, bubbling over
With happiness
Bubbling over with the joy that only love can bring
Bubbling over with the song you taught my heart to sing
And I'm so happy lovin' you that anyone could see
That I'm bubbling over, bubbling over, bubbling over
Because you love me"
"All your love lifting me higher
Than I ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
Then I'll be at your side forevermore
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
Now once I was downhearted
This little loneliness my foes and friend
But when you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
I'm so glad I finally found you
Yes that one in a million girl
And now with my loving arms around you
I can stand up and face the world
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher"
"A cross between a movie star
And a hero in a book
Romeo comes struttin' in
And everybody looks
'Cause he's just got that special thang
That everybody needs
And everybody wants him
But not as bad as me
Hey, Romeo, where art thou
Get out here on the floor
I want to dance you darlin'
'Til you forget wherefore
Let's two step to a new step
We'll keep it all in line
And we'll call this the Romeo
'Cause you're so mighty fine
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo come dance with me
And that sexy little body
Beats all I've ever seen
I ain't never seen a cowboy
Look that good in jeans
My temperature keeps risin'
Every time we meet
I may not be in love
But let me tell you
I'm in heat
Romeo, Romeo, I just know I'll get you yet
Romeo, Romeo, I want to be your Juliet
So step it high, step it low
Step it out and in
Step to the side and let it slide
Then steppin' up again
Step on toes, it all goes
Steppin' as you please
But I'm one step away from love
So don't step out on me
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo with the magic feet
So step it high, step it low
Step it out and in
Step to the side and let it slide
Then steppin' up again
Step on toes, it all goes
Steppin' as you please
But I'm one step away from love
So don't step out on me
Romeo, Romeo
I just know I'll get you yet
Romeo, Romeo
Won't you be my Juliet
Romeo, Romeo
Romeo, Romeo

"We've been a searching for the love that lost its feeling
That one time filled our hearts with fire with love revealing
We thought that love had gone never more to be returning
And the fire that we thought had gone out again is brightly burning
Oh we found it oh we found it yes we found it yeah we found it
Joy to love joy to love we found it
And the lights are way down low the fire of love is high
We found it yes we found it oh we found it oh we found it
Sweet love you and I
[ steel ]
Well I never seen a lovelight shine so bright no wonder we found it
Shining like a neon light with love all around it
It's nights like this with love's sweet bliss sprinkled all around it
We cried a while but now we smile hmm hmm we found it
Oh we found it oh we found...
Oh we found it oh we found..."
"(Dolly Parton)
A broken heart like a broken wing
It must have its time to mend
I am like a crippled bird
In hopes one day to fly again
I loved you so and I was faithful
I cared more than words could say
But love is cruel and life is hateful
Now you've gone and flown away
Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure
Slow to heal, but quick to cry
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly
Oh, the loss is cold and shameful
And the grief so deep and sharp
There is nothing quite as painful
As a true blue broken heart
Oh, to die, 'Twould be a pleasure
Slow to heal, but quick to cry
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly
Fragile as a sparrow's feather
Crippled bird too blue to fly"
"I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time
But that was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine
But that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
I thought I'd stay single always be free
But that was before I met you
I said that no sweet thang could ever hold me
But that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
That was before I met you"
"I'm comin' home, I've done my time
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine
If you received my letter telling you, I'd soon be free
Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me, if you still want me
Whoa, tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
It's been three long years, do you still want me?
If I don't see a ribbon 'round the old oak tree
I'll stay on the bus forget about us, put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
Bus driver, please look for me
'Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see
I'm really still in prison and my love, she holds the key
A simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free
I wrote and told her please
Whoa, tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree
It's been three long years, do you still want me?
If I don't see a ribbon 'round the old oak tree
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us, put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree"
"Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me
Chorus:
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories at all
Or do I ever cross your mind
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darling
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time
Oh, do you ever miss the feelings
And the love we shared when you were with me, do you darling
I just wonder do I cross your mind
Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two loving arms
That once held me so gentle and close
Chorus:
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old memories at all
Or do I ever cross your mind
Do you ever ..."

The mid summer sun shines but dim the fields try in vain to look gay
But when I was happy with him December was pleasant as May
There once was a time he and I picked flowers to braid in my hair
And the songbirds would sing sweet song of love that was tender and fair
No difference the seasons may quit our love was as warm as the sun
And it mattered not where did the snow
Or green grass kissed the fields where we'd run
Now the mid summer sun shines...
Sweet flowers sweet birds and sweet song have now lost their sweetness to me
For ever my darling is gone and for ever my heartbroken I'll be
Now the mid summer sun shines...
The mid summer sun shines but dim mmm"
"Watching the long faces
Riding this run down track
And the lost places
From a dream that never brings them back
And the sad truth is nothing but a cold hard fact
I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train
Counting the burned bridges
Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left
Like a pearl necklace
Fallen from around your neck
I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train
Away down the low road
A ticket to an empty room
A rendezvous unknown
I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train"
"(Dolly Parton)
Once upon a memory
I kissed lips as sweet as honey
And lived in Heaven with an angel
For a little while
I knew love sweet and tender
In a world of perfect splendor
Once upon a memory
Before he said goodbye
Once upon a memory
In Never-Neverland
I had a love I know I'll
Never ever have again
A love like those
You read in fairy tales
Filled with joy and laughter
Oh, but he ended it
And it broke my heart
And I've cried forever-after
Once upon a memory
I knew love beyond compare
Oh, then his sweet lips
Lost their sweetness
And all that Heaven in his eyes
Turned into a cold and distant stare
Gone is the love, sweet and tender
A world of heartache knows no splendor
Oh, but once, once upon a memory
I knew love beyond compare
Yes, once upon a memory
In Never-Neverland
I had a love I know I'll
Never ever have again
A love like those
You read in fairy tales
Filled with joy and laughter
But he ended it
And it broke my heart
And I've cried forever-after
Oh, but once, once upon a memory
I knew love beyond compare
That was once upon a memory"

At last I have called up with you and you're a sight to see
Could this really be my outlaw lover JJ Sneed
Could a woman with a painted face and pretty sweet disguise
Turn your heart against me with her evil cunning eyes her evil cunning eyes
JJ it's been you and me right from the very start
And ever job we ever pulled I'd always done my part
We'd really stick together until the bitter end
And it was my understanding we were whole lots more than friends
A whole lot more than friends
And it was me that kept you on when nights were dark and cold
But I guess I didn't look like much in these old ragged clothes
But you said it didn't matter cause you love me that a way
You said that no one else could ever steal your heart away steal your heart away
Do you recall the Union Bank we robbed in Franklin Town
And as we made our getaway the sheriff gunned you down
And I doctored up your bullet wounds and nursed you while you sit
But now you have betrayed me is that the thanks I get is that the thanks I get
Oh yeah JJ I'm thinking now of how we'd all begun
Of all the times we've robbed and killed with our trust wordy gun
Why we stood off a fuss it was JJ just you and I
But now you have betrayed me and for that you're gonna die
Yeah for that you're gonna die
The good old days are over as we stand here in the rain
JJ I'm gonna shoot you now I hope you'll feel no pain
I hear whoopees of the horses and fieces on my trail
I guess I'll join you soon but for now JJ farewell for now JJ farewell"
"Today you told me that you'd found another
And you took off your golden wedding band
The one you vowed you'd wear until death do us part
When I kissed it and placed it on your hand
A read will hang upon your door tomorrow
Of the little house that we once called our home
And friends will stop and hang their heads in sorrow
To pay the last respects to one gone on
Tonight I lay me down to sleep forever with this small empty bottle and broken heart
I keep the vow I made I won't forsake it I promised to death do us part
Will you bring your new love to the chapel
To look upon the one that you betrayed
Will you bring me pretty flowers like you used to
And replace them in my hands where I lay
Will you cry and think of happy mem'ries that we shared together at the start
And will you look upon me and remember the dsay we said till death do us part"
"(Dolly Parton)
I try hard to forget you and the love I once shared with you
But my mind won't let forgetfulness come in
There's no use in pretending. The hurt is just beginning
Just when I think it's ending you're on my mind again
On my mind again, just like you've always been
On my mind with memories I'm rememberin'
On my mind again, just like you've always been
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again
Sometimes I go to places where certain things erases
All traces of your memory, now and then
Oh, then something will remind me of the love I left behind me
Then again, your memory finds me and you're on my mind again
On my mind again, just like you've always been
On my mind with memories I'm rememberin'
On my mind again, just like you've always been
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again
On my mind again"

Many years you have lingered around my cabin door
Oh hard times come again no more
Oh hard times come again no more
Oh hush a bye hard times, go ye away
Cause my hungry baby wants a Gingerbread Cake
Not a cow in the barn yard no money to spend
Not an egg in the hayloft, no little red hen
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
Oh, hush a bye hard times go ye to rest
Cause my ragged baby wants a new ruffled dress
And she wants some new shoes with buckles to wear
And she wants some silver bows for her golden hair
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
So, hush a bye baby don't cry no more
Your mama can't give you what you're crying for
There's a wolf at the door with an angry
Cold hungry stare, he keeps howling of hard times
And the cupboard is bare
Hush a bye hard times go ye away
I don't intend to be treated this way
So, hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Don't cry no more
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more
Many years you have lingered around my cabin door
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Don't cry no more
Hush a bye hard times
Hush a bye baby
Hush a bye hard times
Come ye no more"
"When troubles surround us, when evils come
The body grows weak
The spirit grows numb
When these things beset us, God doesn't forget us
He sends us His love
On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove
When Jesus went down through the river that day
Well, he was baptized in the usual way
And when it was done
God blessed His son
He sent him His love
On the wings of a dove
On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove"
"Robert's appearance is something to behold
Dressed in the finest of store bought clothes
My mamma sews my clothes cause I'm just a poor girl
But Robert is as real as his daddies gold
Robert could have any girl that he wanted
But his feelings for me each day seems to grow
He don't know the reason, that he's so drawn to me
But there is a story that Robert doesn't know
Oh Robert
Oh Robert
Robert is constantly making eyes at me
He misunderstands the feelings we share
There's no way that I can return his glances
But I know the meaning of the feeling that's there
Robert if you knew, there once was a rich boy
In love with a poor girl, long time ago
But the folks of that rich boy, would not let them marry
And I am a symbol of the love that they stole
Oh Robert
Oh Robert
Robert, oh Robert if you only knew
The same blood is flowing in both me and you
That rich boy's your father, but he's also mine
And my mamma's the poor girl that he left behind
Oh Robert
Oh Robert"
"Oh
The cruel war is raging, Johnny has to fight
And I long to be with him from morning till night
I long to be with him, it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me come with you?
No, my love no
Tomorrow is Sunday, Monday is the day
Your captain will call you and you must obey
Your captain will call you, it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me come with you?
No, my love no, no, no, my love no
No, no, my love, no
But I could tie back my hair, men's clothing I'll put on
And I could march as your comrade as we go along
I could pass as your comrade, no one will ever know
Won't you let me come with you?
No, my love no
Now Johnny, oh Johnny, I feel that you are unkind
You know I love you far better than all of mankind
Yes I love you far better than words could ever express
Please won't you let me come with you?
Yes, yes, my love, yes
Oh yes, yes, yes"
"Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me!
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss-man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
An' the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5, whoa what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
9 to 5, working 9 to 5"
"You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
The day I met you my heart spoke to me
It said to love you through eternity
Now knowing that you were another's bride
I vowed I'll always be close by your side
You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
You broke a heart dear that would die for you
I'd give this world dear to belong to you
The game is over now and we've both lost
A broken heart will have to pay the cost
You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still"

He preached the word of God throughout the land
He praeached so plain a child could understand
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
He told the people of the need to pray
He talked about God's wrath on Judgement Day
He preached about that great eternity
He breathed hell so hot that you could feel the heat
Daddy was an old time preacher man and Leona would get up to testify
As we'd sing in the sweet by and by then we'd sing I'm on my way to Canaan's
Land
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
Revivals and camps meeting's with four weeks
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
But the aisles were all we stilled in altar call
Daddy was an old time preacher man...
Daddy worked for God but asked no pay for he believed that God provides away
We never had a lot but we got by
I guess it's cause the Lord was on my daddy's side
Yes daddy was an old time preacher man
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
I'm on my way to Canaan's Land yes daddy was an old time preacher man
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore
I'm on my way to Canaan's Land yes daddy was an old time preacher man"
"(Dolly Parton)
There's a place in my mind that's suspended in time
When we were happy in love
Days warm and sweet, and the night so complete
Then life was perfect for us
It was just you and I, only love in our eyes
Not a sign of a tear on our face
No sorrow, no pain, only sunshine, no rain
Before something else took its place
Oh, I wanna go back there
Back to the time there was no doubt you cared
Back to the time love was tender and fair
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Do you think if we tried we could put life aside
And see if we might make it back
I know in my heart what we had at the start
I believe it could still be like that
Oh, I wanna go back there
Away from these heartaches, these worried and cares
Back to the time love was tender and fair
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there (say you care)
I wanna go back, I wanna go back
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there
Doop-do-do-do, doop-do-do-do-do
I wanna go back there, I wanna go back there"
"You got a snazzy new car in your driveway
And expensive new clothes on your back
Every short skirt on the highway
Has spent time in your bachelor pad
We dance and you look over my shoulder
And make eyes at somebody else
You swear that you're not, but you know that's a croc
Cause you only care for yourself
Your attitude stinks and I hate it
You're arrogant, cocky and rude
You're selfish, conceited and jaded
Everything's all about you
You think that I'm lucky to have you
You think you're so handsome, so what
I'm callin' you out cause I don't need this crap
I'm gettin' myself outta dodge
Cause you don't know love from shinola
With you love is not what I found
A woman needs someone to hold her
Not someone to just lay her down
I want someone I can count on
A cool headed, warm hearted shoulder
To cry on, rely on, today and from now on
But you don't know love from shinola
You don't know love
From shinola
Oh but I gave you love and affection
But you never gave one iota
It was an early detection
That you don't know love from shinola
You don't know love from shinola
You don't know what true loves about
Well you'll find your world growin' colder
When you're alone and without
So go on, lover boy, have a big time
Drink up on your bourbon and cola
When you sober up you'll be *beep* outta luck
Cause you don't know love from shinola
I'm in it for love, but you're just plain stuck
You don't know love from shinola"

I wasn't looking for you when I found you I just turned and I saw you there
And I was so lonely and lost when I found you and I needed somebody to care
And it had been so long since I'd been happy or needed or wanted or loved
And now that I've found you let my arms around you oh love have mercy on us
Have mercy on us don't let it be wrong for there is nothing to live all alone
And now that you're mine may love treat us kind oh love have mercy on us
Oh what must we do with this love for each other is it wrong to love one so much
I want to be with you and oh how I miss you oh love have mercy on us
Have mercy on us..."
"Familiar sounds tell me it's morning the night has been so dark and long
Each night without you just gets longer
While this torch I still carry just burns stronger
I know I never will stop loving you my tears just can't put out the flame
Or drown my hopes of your returning cause baby the fire's still burning
[ steel ]
Wherever you are I hope you're happy although your love for me has died
But if you ever need or want me I'll take you back any time
I know I never will stop...
Yes baby the fire's still burning"
"If you've been wonderin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin', too
Well I just sittin' here lovin' you
Close my eyes an' lovin' you
I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
An' I have been wonderin' just what I would do
If I weren't sleepin', had I not found you
Well I'd be outside findin' you
I'd be walkin' on the avenue findin' you
Well, I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
Now the reason that you never see me runnin' 'round
Fingers on my forehead couldn't calm me down
An' he can't even get me up and on my feet
When I've got to take care of some business on the street
I have been walkin' all my streets alone
But I won't keep walkin' to keep from goin' home
Couldn't quite barely concieve of you
Aw, an' I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you
If you've been wonderin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin', too
Well I just sittin' here lovin' you
I just close my eyes an' lovin' you
Aw, an' I'm just sittin' back sittin' here lovin' you"
"I want to tell you all a story 'bout a harper valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter that attended harper valley junior high
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said, ""mama, i've got a note here from the harper valley pta""
Well the note says ""mrs. johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high
It's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
Now we don't believe you ought to be a bringin' up your little girl this way""
And it was signed by the secretary, harper valley pta
Well it happened that the pta was gonna meet that very afternoon
And boy, were they surprised as mrs. johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard i can still recall the word she had to say
She said ""i'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley pta
Now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
And mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away
And mr. baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down
Now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's bar again
And if you smell shirley thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think that i ain't fit
Well this is just a little payton place and you're all harper valley hypocrites"
"Sometimes in my sleep I hold you close against my skin
Wakin' up I wish that I could sleep and dream again
'Cause only in my dreams can I know how it might have been
But cheaters never win, their heartaches never end
But sometimes I get crazy as lovers often do
Trying to please him and wondering if she's pleasin' you
Though they have ever right to any part of us they choose
I still live just for you and our secret rendezvous
Torn between two lovers on the jukebox
I'm thinkin' how I could have wrote that song
Wonderin' if God loves us when we're cheatin'
Oh, but why he lets us feel things if it's wrong
And I guess I should be singin' ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"" and some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong
Thou shalt not commit, it's written in the ten
The spirit's always willin', but the flesh is weak again
And you're as close to heaven as I might ever fly
And angel in disguise
A wrong that feels so right
Torn between two lovers just keeps playing
I don't want to be right if lovin' you is wrong
I'm wonderin' if God loves us when we're cheatin'
Oh, but why we have to feel things if it's so wrong
And I guess I should be singin' ""Rock of Ages""
""Amazing Grace"" and some of those good songs
But my cheatin' heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong
My cheatin' heart will tell on me tomorrow
If you think that God won't get you, well you're wrong"
"There's nothing left to tie us to each other anymore
The love we knew is gone and that's a fact we can't ignore
There's nothing left to loose ends on all the ties that bind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
There's no use in wasting the good years that we have left
When we might find happiness with somebody else
There's no chance for us we can see it we're not blind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
The blame belongs to both of us I guess we didn't try
Love is like a garden without care we let it die
The flower of love can't bloom if the sun don't ever shine
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
[ piano ]
The blame belongs to both of us...
Though it hurts we know we must leave it all behind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
You're wasting mine you're wasting mine"

Your trembling hands held me near
Your soft warm lips whispered in my ear
You said you'd always love me
And we'd always be together
And you promised me your love would last forever
Is forever longer than always?
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always
You're gone from me now and you have been for days
And in my mind I can't find the reason why you didn't stay
Unless forever is longer than always
Is forever longer than always?

"I couldn't believe it the day that you left
Cleaned out your closet, cleared off your shelves
Loaded your car and you drove out of sight
But I never said goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open, I leave on a light
I'm always waiting in case you drop by
I'll never say goodbye
People have told me you have a new love
My heart's not willing to give up on us
I've convinced myself they're just telling me lies
And I'll never say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open, I leave on a light
I never wanted you out of my life
And I'll never say goodbye
I'll never say goodbye
The door's always open, I leave on a light
I'll be loving you till the day that I die
And I'll never say goodbye
If you'll just come back, I won't even ask why
I'll never say goodbye, no, I'll never say goodbye"
"It's you that
I run to
Whenever I need to
Darling, you console me
When trouble surrounds me
When bad times have found me
Just reach out your arms and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Darling please take me
In your arms of safety
Reach out your arms
And hold me
Hold me
When my feelings are showing
When my tears are flowing
Just reach out
Reach out and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
You know all of my needs
You fill them completely
You know
That you control me
I depend on
Your lovin'
Without you
I'm nothin'
So reach out
Your arms and hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Darling please take me
In your arms of safety
Reach out you arms
And hold me
Hold me
When life is demanding
When I need understanding
Reach out
Reach out and hold me
Hold me
Hold me"
"Don't try to cry your way out of this
Don't try to lie or I'll catch you in it
Don't try to make me feel sorry for you
Just because I'm blond
Don't think I'm dumb
'Cause this dumb blond ain't nobody's fool
When you left you thought I'd sit
An' you thought I'd wait
An' you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blond
Ah, but somehow I lived through it
And you know if there's one thing this blond has learned
Blonds have more fun
You flew too high up off the ground
It's stormy weather an' had to come back down
But I've found a new thread for my old spool
Just because I'm blond
Don't think I'm dumb
'Cause this dumb blond ain't nobody's fool
When you left you thought I'd sit
An' you thought I'd wait
An' you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blond
Ah, but somehow I lived through it
And you know if there's one thing this blond has learned
Blonds have more fun"

Down on Music Row
Down on music Row
If you want to be a star
That's where you've got to go
I could feel a change a comin'
I left my hometown a hummin'
With my ol' guitar a strummin'
Songs that I had wrote
I was on my way to Nashville
I just couldn't hardly wait
'Till I could sing my songs
To the folks on Music Row
I got into Nashville early
Sleepy, hungry, tired and dirty
And on the steps of RCA
I ate a stale, sweet roll
In the fountain at the hall of fame
I washed my face and read the names
In the walkway of the stars
Down on Music Row
Down on Music Row
Down on music Row
If you want to be a star
That's where you've got to go
I waited there 'till eight o'clock
When office doors became unlocked
Then I started walkin'
Down the streets of Music Row
Just a walkin' up and down the street
Tryin' to find out who to see
To help me get on record
And to hear the songs I'd wrote
But I found it goin' rough
Everyone was all tied up
Either in a conference
Or in the studio
They said that I could leave a tape
But they'd suggest I didn't wait
'Cause everyone was awful busy
Down on Music Row
But I could feel that change a comin'
And I just kept right on a hummin'
With my ol' guitar still strummin'
All them songs that I'd wrote
And then Chet and Bob at RCA
Well, they listened to my songs that day
And they both told me that I was on my way
Down on Music Row
Down on Music Row
Down on music Row
If you want to be a star
That's where you've got to go"
"All your love lifting me higher
Than I ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
Then I'll be at your side forevermore
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
Now once I was downhearted
This little loneliness my foes and friend
But when you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
I'm so glad I finally found you
Yes that one in a million girl
And now with my loving arms around you
I can stand up and face the world
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher"
"(Dolly Parton)
He wanted more from like
Than four kids and a wife
And a job in the dark Kentucky mines
A twenty-acre farm
With a shacky house and barn
That's all he had
And all he left behind
At gambling he was lucky
So he left Kentucky
Left behind his woman and his kids
Into the gay casino
In Nevada's town of Reno
Kentucky gambler planned to get rich quick
Kentucky gambler, who's gonna love your woman in Kentucky
Who's gonna be the one to give her what she needs
Kentucky gambler, who's gonna raise your children in Kentucky
Who's gonna keep them fed and keep shoes on their feet
At the gamblers' paradise
Lady luck was on his side
Kentucky gambler played his cards just right
He won at everything he played
Kentucky gambler had it made
And he should have quit and gone on home that night
But when you love the greenback dollar
Sorrow's always bound to follow
Reno dreams fade into neon amber
And lady luck, she'll leave you on
She'll saty awhile, and then she's gone
You'd better go on home Kentucky gambler
But a gambler never seems to stop
Til he loses all he's got
And so, Kentucky gambler, he played on
He played til he lost all he won
He was right back where he started from
Then he started wanting to go home
Kentucky gambler, there ain't nobody waiting in Kentucky
When you walked out, somebody else walked in
Kentucky gambler, looks like you ain't really very lucky
Seems to me a gambler looses much more than he wins
So you think about it
Kentucky gambler"
"I really got the feeling that I'll love you for a long long time
I felt it from the moment we met you didn't ask me my sign
I love my daddy but it really don't matter what my daddy might say
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day
You're a gentle man
And a gentle man is getting mighty hard to find these days
And you're a tender man
And you're man enough to show your love and tender ways
I really got the feeling that I'll love you for a long long time
I felt it from the moment we met you didn't ask me my sign
I love my daddy but it really don't matter what my daddy might say
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day
I love those silly things you do
You make me feel once more like an innocent child of two
I really got the feeling that I'll love you for a long long time
I felt it from the moment we met you didn't ask me my sign
I love my daddy but it really don't matter what my daddy might say
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day
I really got the feeling got the feeling
I really got the feeling got the feeling
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day"
"(Dolly Parton/Bill Owens)
She married the one I love today
When my back was turned she took him away
Now while they're all outside, waiting to throw rice
What I want to throw will surely black her eyes
'Cause I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad
Well I never stole nothin' in my life
But if I get the chance I'll steal him from his wife
'Cause all is fair in love and war, maybe I'm carryin' this too far
But I feel like tying dynamite to her side of the car"
"When I look out over a green field of clover
Or watch the sun set at the end of the day
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty
And everything's beautiful in its own way
When I see a fountain flow from a mountain
Or see April showers bring flowers to May
I can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder
And everything's beautiful in its own way
Words can't describe what I feel inside
When I see the beauty in each coming day
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
And everything's beautiful in its own way
When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger
The storm's even beautiful in its own way
When I see leaves drop off from the treetop
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder
God made all things beautiful in their own way"
"(Dolly Parton)
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
May his name forever stand
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
Was a mighty, mighty man
And he enriched the lives
Of everyone that ever knew him
And in my song I hope to sing
Some of the praise that's due him
Dr. Thomas was a man
The Lord must have appointed
To live among us mountain folks
In eastern Tennessee
And he delivered more than half
The babies in those mountains
Among those babies
He delivered me
There was no way to drive along
The roads back in those mountains
But Dr. Thomas got there
Just the same
He often rode on horseback
To get where he was needed
But if he had to walk
He always came
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
May his name forever stand
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
Was a mighty, mighty man
And he enriched the lives
Of everyone that ever knew him
And in my song I hope to sing
Some of the praise that's due him
Dr. Thomas was a friend
A neighbor and a doctor
Though he seldom got a dime
For all he'd done
And I remember lots of times
We sent for Dr. Thomas
But I don't recall a time
He didn't come
They say a man is judged
By the deeds he does while livin'
A judgement when he stands
Before the Lord
And I know heaven holds a place
For men like Dr. Thomas
And I know that he'll receive
His just reward
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
May his name forever stand
Dr. Robert F. Thomas
Was a mighty, mighty man
And he enriched the lives
Of everyone that ever knew him
And in my song I hope to sing
Some of the praise that's due him"
"Well, I heard about it
That kind of need that keeps a person sleepless
All that dreaming just the same
And I read about it
I've just decide if someone leaves you breathless
But I never felt that way now I feel It
I'm not so sure I like it
But I feel it consume it be
And it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony, sweet agony, sweet agony
If you had it planned out to give yourself halfway
And leave me wanting more right here on the brink
Well, your time just ran out I've got to hide it all
What are you waiting for
I'm too afraid to think what this thing is
I'm not so sure I like it that expenses just killing me
And it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony, sweet agony, sweet agony
I want the real thing tired of daydreams
And don't you tease me anymore
You've got the real thing to keep me waiting
I never felt like this before
And it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Oh, it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you"

Chorus:
Oh, on a highway headed south somewhere to Dixie
Where the cotton blooms in the spring and the snow don't fly
I'm gonna rest these chillin' bones in the Southern sunshine
And live where the weather's warm until I die
North Dakota, you got my better years
Montana, you got five years of my life
But the earth's sub-zero wind will never touch me again
A Southern girl can't live on snow and ice
Repeat Chorus
When I cross the Dixie line, I'll throw away my coat
And my goose-down underwear will have to go
I'll never live again where the weather chills you to the bone
I'm tired of livin' like an Eskimo
Repeat Chorus
On a highway headed south somewhere to Dixie
Where the cotton blooms in the spring and the snow don't fly
I'm gonna rest these willin' bones in the Southern sunshine
And live where the weather's warm until I die
Repeat Chorus & Fade"
"(Rachel Dennison/Randy Parton/ Frank Dycus)
I know there's times when you must wonder
If my love is true, and I'm satisfied
I wish I knew a way to show you
I'm forever yours for the rest of my life
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'll always be here by your side
My love grows stronger as the time goes by
Cross my heart and hope to die
And all those times we're not together
You're in my heart and you're on my mind
You're like a part of me that's missing
I cross my heart and hope to die
I cross my heart and hope to die
I'll always be here by your side
My love grows stronger as the time goes by
Cross my heart and hope to die
I cross my heart and hope to die
I cross my heart"

Yes I see God where the mountains reach the sky
And I see God when the eagle starts to fly
I see God in a little baby's smile I see God and he makes my life worthwhile
Yes I see God when the bridegroom meets his bride
I see God in a father's loving eyes
I see God when a mother starts to cry I see God in a love that never dies
(I see God) where the people meet to pray (I see God) in the things they do and
say
(I see God) when the little children play
I see God and I know he's near all way

"It's good to be back home again at the Sevier Tennessee
I'm awful glad to see you hope you're glad to see me
Now I'd like to say I love you I welcome to you all

From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
Up the hills and down the mountains and the valleys to the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome and known quite well by all
She's a mighty famous thing called the Wabash Cannonball (Pete Drake)
[ steel - fiddle ]
Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
That's that train from Tennessee boys she's long and she's tall

It's my turn to cry mmm
It's my time
It's my time
It's my time to cry mmmm"
"When you're alone and life is making you lonely
You can always go downtown
When you got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know, downtown
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
And go downtown
Things'll be great when you're downtown
No finer place for sure, downtown
Everything's waiting for you
Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows, downtown
Or maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close, downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of the music that they're playin'
Making conversation while you're on the dance floor swayin'
Happy again
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
And go downtown
Where all the lights are bright, downtown
Waiting for you tonight, downtown
You're gonna be alright now
And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to guide them along
So maybe I'll see you there
You can forget all your troubles
Just forget all your cares
And go downtown
Things'll be great when you're downtown
Don't wait a minute more, downtown
Everything's waiting for you
Downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown, waiting for you tonight
Downtown, you're going to be alright now
Get on, get on, get on downtown
Downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown, waiting for you tonight
Downtown, you're going to be alright now
Get on, get on, get on downtown"
"(Dolly Parton)
Bobby's arms, they are warm when he holds me
Bobby's arms always comfort and console me
When I'm in his arms held tight
I know everything's alright
Just as long as I'm inside bobby's arms
Chorus:
Bobby's arms always welcome me inside
Bobby's arms always hold me when I cry
Bobby's arms are my shelter from life's storms
And I feel so safe in Bobby's arms
Bobby's arms, they are strong but they're tender
Bobby's arms reach for me and I surrender
When he reaches out for me, I'm never out of reach
And I always want to be in Bobby's arms"
"TIE A YELLOW RIBBON ROUND THE OLD OAK TREE
WRITERS RUSSELL BROWN, IRWIN LEVINE
I'm comin' home, I've done my time Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine If you received my letter telling you I'd soon be free Then you'll know just what to do if you still want me If you still want me Just tie a yellow ribbon 'round the old oak tree It's been way too long, do you still want me?

"The first strange town I was ever in
The county was hangin' a man
And nobody cared if he lived or he died
And I just didn't understand
So I washed my face in the morning dew
Bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew
And kept on moving along
The second strange town I was in
They were laughing at a poor crippled man
Begging for nickels and dimes on the street
And I just didn't understand
So I washed my face in the morning dew
Bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew
And kept on moving along
The third strange town that I was in
Was settled peaceful and nice
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer
And to me it didn't seem right
So I washed my face in the morning dew
Bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew
And kept on moving along
Now someday times are bound to change
It can't be very far
And each injustice that I have seen
Will come before the bar
Then I'll wash my face in the morning dew
Bathe my soul in the sun
Wash my face in the morning dew
And my journey will be done"
"(Dolly Parton)
You say that you're bored with life and that you're bored with me
'Cause you say that this love of ours ain't what it ought to be
Now you despise this little house that we've always called home
I know that you don't love me now, but you'll love me when I'm gone
Gone
You'll love me when I'm gone and then you'll realize just what I meant to you
You-oo-oo-oo
You'll miss me when I'm gone and then you'll realize how good I've been to you
You-ooo-ooo-ooo
You'll want me when I'm gone and then you'll realize you've loved me all along
Oh, it's true you may not love me now, but you'll love me when I'm gone
Gone
We've grown too familiar with each other, so you say
You say there's no excitement now. Too bad you feel that way
Well, I wonder how exciting that your life will be alone
Oh, I know you may not want me now, but you'll miss me when I'm gone
Gone
You'll love me when I'm gone and then you'll realize just what I meant to you
You-oo-oo-oo
You'll miss me when I'm gone and then you'll realize how good I've been to you
You-ooo-ooo-ooo
You'll want me when I'm gone and then you'll realize you've loved me all along
Oh, I know you may not want me now, but you'll miss me when I'm gone
Gone"
"(Dolly Parton)
Well I remember when I was just little
Mama used to cook on an old black kettle
On an old wood stove she'd had since she was wed
Well the oven door was sprung a little bit
So we propped it up with a forked stick
But that didn't matter cause Mama kept us fed
My mama and daddy must have loved each other
Cause I had eleven sisters and brothers
And the girls worked just as hard as the boys did
There was corn to hoe then we'd go hoe it
We might have been poor but we didn't know it
We'd heard that word but we didn't know what it meant
Oh we used to have such a good life
And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known
And oh didn't we have such a good time
It's sad to think the old black kettle's gone
Well there was nothing that pleased us any better
Than when we got an occasional letter
From kin folks livin' up north in some big town
We'd think of all the games we'd play
And we just couldn't hardly wait
When our city cousins said they'ze a comin' down
Now Mama's done away with the old black kettle
She used to cook in when I was just little
And the door ain't sprung on her electric range
That little farm and home we had
It ain't there no more and that's too bad
Folks are doin' away with the simple things
And oh we used to have such a good life
And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known
And oh didn't we have such a good time
It's sad to think the old black kettle's gone"
"All your love lifting me higher
Than I ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
Then I'll be at your side forevermore
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
Now once I was downhearted
This little loneliness my foes and friend
But when you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher
I'm so glad I finally found you
Yes that one in a million girl
And now with my loving arms around you
I can stand up and face the world
You know your love keeps on lifting me higher
Higher and higher
I said your love keeps on lifting me
Higher and higher"
"I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While traveling through this world of woe
Yet there's no sickness, toil or danger
In that bright world yo which I go
I'm going there to see my father
I'm going there no more to ram
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home
I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me
Where God's redeemed their vigils keep
I'm going there to my mother
She said she'd meet me when I come
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over me"
"(Dolly Parton)
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
Just because it feels right does not make it so
So we struggle through life in horns and halos
Tempted and tried with each step we take
We stumble and slide and make our mistakes,
Ask God to forgive us for all of our sins,
Then we take off our horns and wear halos again
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
Just because it feels right does not make it so
So we struggle through life in horns and halos
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
We're praised or we're scorned, we either run or we faint
Oh, but life is a challenge from the day that we're born
Just tryin' to balance halos and horns
It's heaven or hell, halos or horns
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
But just because it feels right; well, that don't make it so
So we struggle through life in horns or halos
It's either horns or halos"
"My baby makes me proud
Lord, don't he make me proud
He never makes a scene
Hangin' all over me in a crowd
'Cause people like to talk
Lord, don't they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights
I know he'll be leavin' with me
And when we get behind closed doors
Then we let out hair hang down
Then he makes me glad that he's my man
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
My baby makes me smile
Lord, don't he make me smile
I'm never far away
Or too tired to say I want to
I'm purring like a kitten
When he's out in public with me
But when they turn out the lights
He brings out the tiger in me
And when we get behind closed doors
Then we let out hair hang down
Then he makes me glad that he's my man
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors"
"(Dolly Parton)
I remember, I remember
I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember meadows and fields of golden wheat
I remember song birds and sugar cane so sweet
I remember lots of things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember ginger bread my momma used to bake
I remember home-made toys that Daddy used to make
Yes, I remember many things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember momma and daddy most of all
In our little country home they filled with love
I remember momma and daddy most of all
And all the things they did to make life happier for us
Yes I remember lots of things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember candy that daddy used to bring
I remember songs my momma used to sing
Oh I Remember many things that often I recall
But I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember momma and daddy most of all
And how they taught us children right from wrong
I remember momma and daddy most of all
How they used to hope and pray they'd live to see us grown
Oh I remember many things that often I recall
I remember momma and daddy most of all
I remember, I remember
I remember momma and daddy most of all
Most of all"
"Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through
Oh I know I'm gonna miss you
But I hope it ain't for long
And I wonder if you're even gonna notice that I'm gone
Oh it hurts to know you cheated
And it hurt to know you lied
But it hurts me even worse to know you never even tried
I packed my suitcase full of heartaches
Headin' for the train depot
And I bought a one-way ticket
On that train they call Blue Smoke
I left the station straight-up midnight
Feelin' lonely, lost and blue
In a trail of blue smoke with my heart broke
Said good-bye to you
Blue smoke climbin' up the mountain
Blue smoke windin' round the bend
Blue smoke is the name of the heartbreak train
That I am ridin' in
I left a note I wrote I'm leaving
And I won't be coming back
Blue smoke rolling, rolling, rolling
Rolling, rolling down the track
Oh, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee, click-ad-ee clack
Just stay on track an' never look back
Choo-choo, choo-choo, woo-woo-woo
Blue smoke is comin' through"

I wasn't looking for you when I found you I just turned and I saw you there
And I was so lonely and lost when I found you and I needed somebody to care
And it had been so long since I'd been happy or needed or wanted or loved
And now that I've found you let my arms around you oh love have mercy on us
Have mercy on us don't let it be wrong for there is nothing to live all alone
And now that you're mine may love treat us kind oh love have mercy on us
Oh what must we do with this love for each other is it wrong to love one so much
I want to be with you and oh how I miss you oh love have mercy on us
Have mercy on us..."
"Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me
Chorus:
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories at all
Or do I ever cross your mind
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darling
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time
Oh, do you ever miss the feelings
And the love we shared when you were with me, do you darling
I just wonder do I cross your mind
Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two loving arms
That once held me so gentle and close
Chorus:
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old memories at all
Or do I ever cross your mind
Do you ever ..."
"When I look out over a green field of clover
Or watch the sun set at the end of the day
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty
And everything's beautiful in its own way
When I see a fountain flow from a mountain
Or see April showers bring flowers to May
I can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder
And everything's beautiful in its own way
Words can't describe what I feel inside
When I see the beauty in each coming day
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
And everything's beautiful in its own way
When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger
The storm's even beautiful in its own way
When I see leaves drop off from the treetop
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder
God made all things beautiful in their own way"
"(Gale Garnett)
We'll sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
I will never love you
The cost of love's too dear
But though I'll never love you
I'll live with you one year
And we will sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
I'll sing to you each morning
I'll kiss you every night
But darlin', don't cling to me
I'll soon be out of sight
But we can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
My daddy he once told me
Hey, don't you love you any man
Just take what they can give you
And give but what you can
And you can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
And when our year has ended
And I have gone away
I'll often speak about you
And this is what I'll say
You know we sang in the sunshine
We laughed every day
We sang in the sunshine
Then I went on my way"
"(Dolly Parton)
In my mind I've made love to you often
But only in my mind can it be so
'Cause there's someone at home that's countin' on me
And if I did, I'm sure that he would know
Yes, he would know, yes, he could tell
For, he has loved me long enough to know me very well
And if I lied, he'd see it in my eyes
I know my guilt would show and he would know
But I must admit you're someone very special
And it would be so easy to let go
Makin' love to you could be so easy
But if I did, I'm sure that he would know
Yes, he would know, yes, he could tell
For, he has loved me long enough to know me very well
And if I lied, he'd see it in my eyes
I know my guilt would show and he would know
My conscience just won't let me make love to you
I know it would be sweet, but I just can't
When I go home to him I must be able
To look him in the eyes and say I ain't
'Cause he would know, yes, he could tell
For, he has loved me long enough to know me very well
And if I lied, he'd see it in my eyes
I know my guilt would show and he would know
He would know"

Bobby's arms, they are warm when he holds me

When I'm in his arms held tight

Bobby's arms always hold me when I cry

Bobby's arms reach for me and I surrender
When he reaches out for me, I'm never out of reach
And I always want to be in Bobby's arms"
"As time goes by the tales grow taller about possum in Possum Holler
As a young man I'd go a courtin' with my sweetheart so young and fair
Down the mountain to Possum Holler that's where he'd always find me waitin' there
Now I tell my mama that I's goin' out walkin' neath the moonlight so bright and fair
And I'd tell daddy I was huntin' possum
And take off a grinnin' and a slickin' down my hair
As time goes by the tales grow taller about possum in Possum Holler
Then one evening in Possum Holler my sweetheart's daddy stopped all our fun
Yeah we got married in Possum Holler just you and me my daddy and daddy's gun
As time goes by the tales grow taller about possum in Possum Holler
Now when they see a possum hunter young and handsome and a smellin' fair
We just lean back and bust our laughin' cause we know there ain't no possum there
As time goes by the tales grow taller about possum in Possum Holler
About possum in Possum Holler"
"Look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
Hey, look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
It's the Orange Blossom Special
Bringin' my baby back
Well, I'm going down to Florida
And get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californy
And get some sand in my shoes
I'll ride that Orange Blossom Special
And lose these New York blues

""When am I goin' back to Florida? I don't know, don't reckon I ever will.""

"Baby, won't you come out tonight
Just come up the hill 'cause there's a full moon on the risin'
Hey baby, can't you steal away
You know I really need to see you tonight
I just got word you was packin' it in
What's the matter, this old town got you crazy again
I can see the sad look in your eyes
But I don't know how to say goodbye
And tomorrow, you're gonna have your day
Take your wife and you're gonna run away
Baby, while I'm wailin'
You'll be sailin' like a hog across the bay singin'
Ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Baby, won't you come out tonight
Oh baby, won't you come out tonight
We'll run up the hill and we'll dance in the moonlight
Let me gaze into your eyes 'til we both go blind
Oh baby, can I see you tonight
I'm just tryin' to find a way to make it last
Good friends, they seem to slip away so fast
An' I know we're both headed down separate tracks
An' when ya' go, baby don't look back
There won't be no more sleepin' over on a Tuesday night
No more runnin' to the races for a dark horse at midnight
No more dancin' after hours, singin' in the showers
Or clingin' to each other in the soft mornin' light singin'
Ooo, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
I'll meet ya' on the corner
And you'll be there at midnight
Oh baby, can you steal away
You know I really want to see ya' tonight
Ooo baby, can you come out tonight
We'll run up the hill and dance again in the moonlight
Oh baby, can you steal away
I really wanna see you tonight
Oh baby, won't ya' come out tonight
Come up the hill, there's a full moon on the rise
Oh baby, can ya' steal away
Baby, won't ya' come out tonight"

Folks back home think I'm a star now when they hear my records play
They say there home town girl made good and she'd go a long long way
Mom wonders why I don't drive back in that big fine car I own
The truth is I don't have a car and I'm ashamed to go back home
A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick
A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit
These are all my possessions all I have to my name
And a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame
I'm so glad that dad can't see me now, his favorite little girl
Singing in this dingy place on the wrong side of the world
And I'm glad that I can't see the boy that offered me his name
For I was blind and turned from him in this empty search for fame
A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick
A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit
These are all of my possessions, all I have to my name
And a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame"
"I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love with a girl,
That's what's the matter with me
I'm in love,
I'm in love, with a beautiful girl,
But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,
How I sighed and I cried
But she just refused
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,""
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone
I'm yearning for it yet
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy""
Twas just a beautiful dream
I hate to think that it's all over I lost my heart it seems
I got so used to her somehow
But I'm no body's baby
Now, gee it's awful when you're lonesome
and get those lovesick blue-oo-oo-oo-oo's
Got the feeling called the ""blue hoo's,""
since my sweetie said ""Good Bye""
Seems I don't know what to ""Do Hoo""
All day long I sit and cry
That last long day we spent alone
I'm yearning for it yet
She thrilled me, filled me,
with a kind of lovin',
I never will forget, the way she called me sweet daddy
Twas just a beautiful dream"

If there ever was an angel, then surely you must be one
If there ever was a perfect love when I look at you I see one
If there's heaven on earth, then this must surely be
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
The last thing I remember before I go to sleep
Is the touch of your sweet lips softly kissing me
And I go to sleep athinking how happy you make me
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
And when it's time to lay me down for my eternal sleep
Once more let your fingers softly touch my cheek
If I know that you have touched me, then I can sleep in peace
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
And when the night is over and time will be no more
They say that we shall meet again upon the golden shore
And so when I awaken from my eternal sleep
I want you to be the first one to touch me
I want you to be the first, the last, the only one to touch me"

Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear me, are you listenin' any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speakin' terms
Can you help me like before?
I have questioned your existence,
My resistance leaves me cold
Can you help me go the distance?
Hello God, hello, hello
This old world has gone to pieces
Can we fix it, is there time?
Hate and violence just increases
We're so selfish, cruel and blind
We fight and kill each other
In your name, defending you
Do you love some more than others?
We're so lost and confused
Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear us, are you listenin' any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speakin' terms
Can you help us like before?
Oh, the free will you have given
We have made a mockery of
This is no way to be livin',
We're in great need of your love
Hello God
Hello God, can you grant us
Love enough to make amends
(Hello God) Is there still a chance
That we could start again
Hello God, we've learned our lesson
Dear God, don't let us go
More than ever
Hello God, hello, hello
Hello God, we really need you
We can't make it without you
(Hello God) We beseech you
In the name of all that's true
Hello God, please forgive us
For we know not what we do
Hello God, give us one more chance to prove ourselves to you
Hello, God; hello, God"
"Oh the monkey's had a better tale than you
Compare to yours all their tales sound so true
The way you're actin' seems to me at all the monkey should go free
You're the one that should be locked up in the Zoo
When I married you I thought you were a man
But you're the biggest ape that's living in this land
I'd like to run you up a tree for the way you lie to me
Your swingin' round is gettin' out of hand
Oh the monkey's had...
Every monkey has its day so go ahead and play
Make your plans and tell your lies and stick to them
But from now on I remind you can wag your tail behind you
Cause you finally got yourself out on a limb

Every monkey has its day...
Oh the monkey's had a better tale than you"

It's so hard for me to believe

'Cause you're making plans to leave
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave"
"(Dolly Parton/Dorothy Jo Hope)
In this mental institution, lookin' out through these iron bars
How could he put me in here, how could he go that far
Yes I need help but not this kind, he didn't love me from the start
But it's not my mind that's broken, it's my heart
Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you
I'm depending on you Daddy, there's nothing I can do
And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need
But Daddy I can't come to you, you'll have to come to me
When he said he loved another, I was crazy with jealousy
That's 'cause I was crazy over him and I couldn't stand to set him free
And I couldn't stand to lose him and I cried and cried for days
And he said that I was crazy but he just put me in here to get me out of his way
Daddy come and get me
Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you
I'm depending on you Daddy 'cause there's nothing else I can do
And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need
But Daddy I can't come to you, you'll have to come to me"
"There are those who'd love to love me
Take me home and take care of me
Treat me just the way you never do
But I'm here on your door step
Something I can't seem to help
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you
[Chorus:]
Oh, you don't love me, you don't love me
You place everything above me
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you
You don't want me, you don't want me
You just hurt and disappoint me
Like a fool, I'm holding on to, ooh, ooh
Like a fool, I'm holding on to you
What is this spell that's on me
Make me think you own me
Why do I keep holding on to you
I just can't shake the feeling
I only know it's real
And I keep holding, holding, holding on to you
[Chorus:]"
"Loving you isn't good for me you keep my tears flowing
If I loved you I couldn't stay gone so there's no use in going
Loving you is a habit I can't break
I haven't found a way yet but I've been tryin'
To stop loving you but I can't wait there's no use a lyin'
Loving you is a habit I can't break
Loving you is a habit I can't break
I've been loving you much too long now to change the way I feel
So I might as well get used to these heartaches
Loving you is a habit I can't break
[ piano ]
(A habit I can't break)
Loving you is a habit I can't break...
Loving you is a habit I can't break"
"Am I to face these lonely halls alone
And when you leave, who's gonna walk me home
Cause when you walk out the door I won't see you no more
And you're the one I adore so baby
Chorus:
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't be a fool
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)
You're old enough to know you're too young to face the world so cruel
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)
You're not prepared to do anything
So if you wanna buy me that diamond ring, well
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't drop out
My parents say you're lazy but you can be smart if you try
And I know you've got a heart cause you've never ever made me cry
They say you're no good so baby do what you should
And stay here by my side oh darlin'
Repeat Chorus
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)
Don't drop out of my life
Baby, don't drop out
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)"
"Two little children a boy and a girl
Sat by an old church door
The little girl's feet
Were as brown as the curl
That fell on the dress that she wore
The little boy's cloths were all tattered and torn
They shown beneath his blue eyes
Why don't you go home
To you mommy I said
And this was the maddens reply
Mommy's in heaven
Angels took her away
Left Tim and I all alone
We've no one to love us
And daddy is dead
And our darling mother is gone
Mommy got sick
Angels took her away
To dwell in those mansions so bright
She said she would come
For her children some day
And I guess she's coming tonight
The sexton came early
To ring the church bell
And found them
Beneath the snow white
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell
Up in heaven with their mommy that night"
"Tonight my heart is sad and weary
Wonderin' if I'm wrong or right
I dream about you though you've left me
I wonder where you are tonight
The rain is cold and slowly fallin'
Upon my window pane tonight
And though you're love was even colder
I wonder where you are tonight
It's spring, the birds are gaily singing
The trees are blossoming so sweet
No other love was quite so happy
No other love was so complete
The rain is cold and slowly fallin'
Upon my window pane tonight
And though you're love was even colder
I wonder where you are tonight
Then came the dawn the day you left me
I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me
It still lingers in my heart tonight
Oh, the rain is cold and slowly fallin'
Upon my window pane tonight
And though you're love is even colder
I wonder where you are tonight"
"(Dolly Parton)
If I should stay
Well, I would only be in your way
And so I'll go, and yet I know
That I'll think of you each step of my way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Bitter-sweet memories
That's all I have, and all I'm taking with me
Good-bye, oh, please don't cry
'Cause we both know that I'm not
What you need
But I will always love you
I will always love you
And I hope life, will treat you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
Oh, I do wish you joy
And I wish you happiness
But above all this
I wish you love
I love you, I will always love
I will always, always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you"
"I've been down on my luck,
I've been shadowed with trouble and sorrow.
But I ain't givin' up'
'Cause I know there is always tomorrow.
There are no guarantees,
Life is always a hit or miss.
But I truly believe
I won't always be feeling' like this.
I'm gonna shine like the sun
When these clouds roll away from my door.
When it's all said and done
I won't be at your mercy no more.
I will prove my own worth,
Heal the damage and hurt that's been done.
And when the cryin's all done.
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
I've been thinking here lately
What all I can do to improve.
Though I've suffered greatly,
I know just what I have to do.
I have to move forward,
Cut losses, break loose and move on.
And I have to swim shoreward
Lest I should drown out here alone.
I'm gonna shine like the sun
When these clouds roll away from my door.
I won't crawl I can run
I'll be at no ones mercy no more.
I'll be swinging on sunbeams
So proud that I finally won.
And when the losin's all done.
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna shine.
I'm gonna shine like the sun.
When these clouds roll away from my door.
And when it's all said and done
I won't be at your mercy no more.
I'll be off chasin' rainbows,
Rejoicin' and havin' my fun.
And when the cryin's all done,
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
When the cryin's all done,
When the tryin's all done,
When the lyin's all done
There'll be nothin' but sun.
When it's all said and done
Well, I'm gonna shine like the sun.
Shine like the sun, shine like the sun."
"(Dolly Parton)
This is not at all like me
I never thought that I could be
So over-come by any one like this
But you caught me by surprise
Caught me before I realized, now
I am lost forever in your kiss
So take me if you want me
Love me if you will
For you have all control of me
I am yours until
You say that you don't want me
Oh, I hope that never will be
For I am lost forever in your kiss
You're on my mind constantly
On, this is all so new to me
And when you reach for me I can't resist
For I've become a part of you
And I'll do anything you want me to, for"
"Am I to face these lonely halls alone
And when you leave, who's gonna walk me home
Cause when you walk out the door I won't see you no more
And you're the one I adore so baby
Chorus:
Don't drop out of my life, baby, don't be a fool
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)
You're old enough to know you're too young to face the world so cruel
(Don't drop out, baby, don't drop out now)
You're not prepared to do anything

"(Bill Owens)
Like the morning sun
His love moved across every inch of my body
And the heat from the fire burned me up with desire
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven for sure
This morning when I opened my eyes
There to my surprise
Lay that angel I thought had been only a dream
And so I said a little prayer
And thanked God, that he was there
Oh, this is a dream come true
Dream do come true
I know 'cause I found you
I never thought they did
But now I do
Dreams do come true
It was love at first sight
And it was love all night
And the way he made love to me
Fulfilled all my fantasies
Ooo, this is a dream come true
Yes, dreams do come true
I know 'cause I found you
I never thought they did
But you're living proof
That dreams do come true
Dreams do come true
And I am so in love with you"
"(Dolly Parton)
The greatest gift, the gift of life
The gift of love divine
God gave us all a special gift
He meant for it to shine
He meant for it to shine
The darkest night can be made light
By one bright word or smile
If we'd put on our neighbor's shoes
And choose to walk a mile
God gave us all our own free will
To choose the paths we take
No greater deed could e'er be done
Than for another's sake
The greatest gift, the gift of life
The gift of love divine
God gave us all a special gift
He meant for it to shine
He meant for it to shine
Shine on, shine on, for all to see
God's light inside your soul
Shine on, shine on, let love flow free
Warm others in its glow
Shine on, shine on, shine on
So hide it not or it will fade
Shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on, shine on
The greatest gift, the gift of life
The gift of love divine
God gave us all a special gift
He meant for it to shine
Shine on, shine on, shine on"
"(Dolly Parton)
I've tried and I've tried for so long to please you
Gave you every bit of my time
Gave you everything I could possibly give you
My body, my heart, and my mind
I turned my family and good friends against me
Listened to my own heart break
And I did it all in the name of love
Gave up myself for your sake
And you never cared about me
You only hurt and deceive
I realize after all of these years
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears
You've cheated, you've lied and you've hurt me
Over and over again
You promised to love me forever
But forever reached a bitter sweet end
Been blinded by love to your actions
But at last I can see my way clear
I've cried and I've tried, and I've tried and I've cried
But you, you've never shed one tear
'Cause you never cared about me
You only hurt and deceive
I realize after all of these years
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears
You ain't worth, you ain't worth the salt in my tears
Treated like dirt, I'm hurt, I ain't hangin' 'round here
You've left me crying, left me crying for years
But you ain't worth the salt in my tears
You never cared about me
You only hurt and decieve
I realize after all of these years
That you ain't worth the salt in my tears
No you ain't worth the salt in my tears"
"(A wish that Malena had wings)
Malena for hours would run in the meadow
Well Malena would go to play every day
She chased butterflies and she'd say with the smile
If I had wings I could fly that away
Malena would cry when we try to explain
That little girl's world's supposed to have wings
That only in heaven can little girls fly
We'd see a strange look in Malena's eyes
(A wish that Malena had wings)
We'll always remember Malena's last birthday
Boxes with bright colored ribbon and string
And the wish that she made as she blew out the candles
A wish that Malena had wings
And with all the gifts that we bought for Malena
The wish that she made we could not satisfy
But on the night of her birthday the angels fullfilled it
They gave her wings and now Malena can fly"
"Sometimes I try to count the ways and reasons that I love you
But I can't ever seem to count that far
I love you in a million ways and for a million reasons
More than this I love you as you are
More than this I love you as you are
You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are
You are my thoughts when I'm awake, my dreams when I'm asleep
You are the reason for my smile, you are the words I speak
Every role I play in life you play the leading part
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are"
"When I sing for him oh praise God's holy name I can feel his presence in my soul
When I sing for him oh blessed be his name how I rejoice within when I sing for him
As I sing a melody that he gave when I speak God's name in song or kneel to pray
Oh I have a special feeling deep within when I sing for him
When I sing for him in person hallelujah when I look to my new home hallelujah
Oh the angels will be singing hallelujah amen when I sing for him when I sing for him"
"Oh
The cruel war is raging, Johnny has to fight
And I long to be with him from morning till night
I long to be with him, it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me come with you?
No, my love no
Tomorrow is Sunday, Monday is the day
Your captain will call you and you must obey
Your captain will call you, it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me come with you?
No, my love no, no, no, my love no
No, no, my love, no
But I could tie back my hair, men's clothing I'll put on
And I could march as your comrade as we go along
I could pass as your comrade, no one will ever know
Won't you let me come with you?
No, my love no
Now Johnny, oh Johnny, I feel that you are unkind
You know I love you far better than all of mankind
Yes I love you far better than words could ever express
Please won't you let me come with you?
Yes, yes, my love, yes
Oh yes, yes, yes"
"Satan's got river Satan's got river deep and wide so deep and wide
Satan's got a river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming he's got folks a swimming
In the warm smooth tire
But some day Satan's river
Yes some day Satan's river is gonna run dry it's gonna run dry
What was once a smooth river hot lava will make the tide
Stay clear of Satan's river heaven's on either side
Big yachts are sailing Satan's river so smooth
Never stopping or thinking about God's golden rule
When the river starts to sinking they'll cry I've been a fool
Satan's got river deep and wide
Satan's got river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming in the warm smooth tide"

Yes I see God where the mountains reach the sky
And I see God when the eagle starts to fly
I see God in a little baby's smile I see God and he makes my life worthwhile
Yes I see God when the bridegroom meets his bride
I see God in a father's loving eyes
I see God when a mother starts to cry I see God in a love that never dies
(I see God) where the people meet to pray (I see God) in the things they do and
say
(I see God) when the little children play
I see God and I know he's near all way
I see God yes I see God"
"Who do you think you are
What do you think this is
A game you can play
Tryin' to steal him away
Well, I don't need a heartache like this
Well, don't think I don't go through hell
But heaven is what we both want
He's easy to love, but he's hard to give up
And if you think I will, well, you're wrong
The best woman wins
I will fight 'til the end
I'll lay down and die if I must
I'll beg and I'll plead
I will suffer and bleed
But he must make a choice between us
This soap opera play that we're in
Is just like you watch on t.v.
But I never thought that I'd ever get caught in it;
Starring you, him and me
In love as in war all is fair
So a fight to the finish begins
When you fight from desire
You fight fire with fire
So may the best woman win
The best woman wins
I will fight 'til the end
I'll lay down and die if I must
I'll beg and I'll plead
I will suffer and bleed
But he must make a choice between us
So may the best woman win"
"Let's live for tonight dear it's better that way tomorrow we might be apart
Let's live for tonight dear let love let its way
For tomorrow we could have two broken hearts
Lets cast all our worries and heartaches inside forget what the future might hold
Let's live for tonight dear in a world all our own
For tomorrow we may have to be alone
Let's live for tonight dear and try to pretend that we will never be alone
No matter what happened this night will be ours
What tomorrow brings nobody ever knows
For tomorrow we may have to be alone"

Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack 'til the mail comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
I ain't gonna work on the railroad
I ain't gonna work on the farm
Lay down the shack 'til the mail train comes back
And I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms
Now where were you last Friday night
While I was lying in jail
Walking the streets with another man
Wouldn't even go my bail
I know you parents don't like me
They drove me away from your door
If I had my life to live over
I'd never go there any more"
"(Dolly Parton)
Well I remember when I was just little
Mama used to cook on an old black kettle
On an old wood stove she'd had since she was wed
Well the oven door was sprung a little bit
So we propped it up with a forked stick
But that didn't matter cause Mama kept us fed
My mama and daddy must have loved each other
Cause I had eleven sisters and brothers
And the girls worked just as hard as the boys did
There was corn to hoe then we'd go hoe it
We might have been poor but we didn't know it
We'd heard that word but we didn't know what it meant
Oh we used to have such a good life
And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known
And oh didn't we have such a good time
It's sad to think the old black kettle's gone
Well there was nothing that pleased us any better
Than when we got an occasional letter
From kin folks livin' up north in some big town
We'd think of all the games we'd play
And we just couldn't hardly wait
When our city cousins said they'ze a comin' down
Now Mama's done away with the old black kettle
She used to cook in when I was just little
And the door ain't sprung on her electric range
That little farm and home we had
It ain't there no more and that's too bad
Folks are doin' away with the simple things
And oh we used to have such a good life
And the days that I knew then are the happiest I've known
And oh didn't we have such a good time
It's sad to think the old black kettle's gone"
"A light shines from my window
I just can't sleep no more
Lord, it hurts so much to be alone
But the real men never do admit
That it's them that might be wrong
At least that's what he told me in his song
He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind
The freedom that he sings about
I guess I'll never know
I just can't shake the guilt or kill the pain
But he lets me ride when the lights turns low
Get on board the radio and take a ride to Texas on his train
He rode all the way to Texas
On an old freight train
Didn't miss the girl he left behind
He rode all the way to Texas
Didn't shed a tear
He's lettin' you know that he's the movin' kind"
"Bows and flows of angel hair and ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun they rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done, but clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels the dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real, I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show, you leave 'em laughin' when you go
And if you care don't let them know, don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud, to say, ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange they shake their heads, they say
I've changed
But something's lost but something's gained in living every day
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all"
"You and me and her and him must get together
And see if maybe we can find a way
To put an end to hurting one another
Cause he don't know and she don't know how much we hurt each day
It's not fair and you and I both know it
To have to hide and love the way we do
The time is now that we must get together
Her and him me and you
[ steel - fiddle ]
She and I had lost it long before I met you
We tried and tried but all the love had gone
And I guess respect is all that's kept me with him
Cause there hasn't been no love there in so long
It's not fair and you and I both know it...
Her and him me and you"
"Well, I heard about it
That kind of need that keeps a person sleepless
All that dreaming just the same
And I read about it
I've just decide if someone leaves you breathless
But I never felt that way now I feel It
I'm not so sure I like it
But I feel it consume it be
And it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony, sweet agony, sweet agony
If you had it planned out to give yourself halfway
And leave me wanting more right here on the brink
Well, your time just ran out I've got to hide it all
What are you waiting for
I'm too afraid to think what this thing is
I'm not so sure I like it that expenses just killing me
And it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony, sweet agony, sweet agony
I want the real thing tired of daydreams
And don't you tease me anymore
You've got the real thing to keep me waiting
I never felt like this before
And it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Sweet agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you, I beg for you to set me free
From this agony, sweet agony
Oh, what if I take control so easily
Oh, it's agony, sweet agony
I ain't for you"

I grew up dirty and I grew up poor
The wolf didn't even hang 'round our door
Not a crumb to spare and the cupboard bare
And I had the gift of imagination
I could change my situation
Anytime I choose I could always go
Down Paradise Road
I found a kingdom deep within
A place dream and to pretend
And to prepare for the world out there
A dream can dress you when you're ragged
Fill you up when hunger's naggin'
I warmed my soul when life was cold
On Paradise Road
Chorus:
Paradise is a state of mind
The sun shines warm and all the time
And the rain don't flow and the wind don't blow
On Paradise Road
A place no one can take from me
A place of everlasting peace
Where dreamers go; It's never closed
Paradise Road
Paradise is a state of mind
Down the road of life and time
And the friends we meet
Make the travlin' sweet
On Paradise Road
Sometimes now when the world is mad
I find that place I've always had
Inside my soul; It's paved in gold
Paradise Road
I grew up dirty and I grew up poor
The wolf didn't even hang 'round our door
Not a crumb to spare and the cupboard bare
But I had the gift of imagination
I could change my situation
Anytime I choose I could always go
Down Paradise Road"
"You lie in gentle sleep beside me
I hear your warm and rhythmic breathing
I take your hand and hold it tightly
Listen
Can you not hear our young hearts beating
I kiss the sleep from your eyes
Your smile is sweeter than the morning
Here it comes
Can't you feel it Baby
Can't you feel it
Here comes
Feel it
Feel it
Fire
Fire
Something's Burning
Something's Burning
Something's Burning
Something's Burning I think it's love
I believe it's love
And now the sun is burning brightly
We lie in love so close together
I get the feeling deep inside me
My love for you will burn forever
I cup my hands to touch your face
Once again I feel your fire
Here it comes
Can't you feel it Baby
Can't you feel it
Here comes
Feel it
Feel it
Fire

Something's Burning

"How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
And how many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know
So always make me wonder
And always make me guess
Even if I ask you
Darlin', don't confess
No you just let that remain your secret
'Cause darlin' I do love you so
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know"
"When I look out over a green field of clover
Or watch the sunset at the end of the day
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty
An' everything's beautiful in it's own way
I see a fountain flow from a mountain
Or see April showers bring flowers to May
I can't help but ponder, life is such a wonder
An' everything's beautiful in it's own way
Words can't describe what I feel inside
When I see the beauty in each coming day
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
An' everything's beautiful in it's own way
When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger
The storm's even beautiful in it's own way
When I see the leaves drop from off of the treetops
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder
God, made all things beautiful in their own way
Words can't describe what I feel inside
When I see the beauty in each coming day
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
An' everything's beautiful in it's own way
In it's own way
In it's own way"
"Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and see"
"Somebody's missing you
Longs to be kissing you
You'd better listen
You mean all the world to me
You're on somebody's mind
Just almost all the time
Bet you already knew
Somebody's missing you
The days go slowly by
When I'm away from you
I long to see your smile
And feel the warmth of you
I've loved you for so long
But still we feel brand new
At home, inside your arms
Somebody's missing you
Somebody's missing you
Longs to be kissing you
You'd better listen
You mean all the world to me
You're on somebody's mind
I hope you miss me too
Somebody's missing you
Last thought before I sleep
First thought when I awake
You're even in my dreams
And I can hardly wait
To hear your voice again
Saying all the things you do
In case you're wondering
Somebody's missing you
Somebody's missing you
Longs to be kissing you
You'd better listen
You mean all the world to me
You're on somebody's mind
Just almost all the time
I know you know I do
Somebody's missing you
In case you're wondering
Somebody's missing you
Really, really, really, really missing you"
"I couldn't wait forever
Did you expect me to
I guess you thought I'd never
Find somebody new
I lived on dreams and promises
As long as I could
I couldn't wait forever
The way you thought I would
The lonely nights grew longer
As I prayed for time to fly
I lived on hopes that you'd return
And that's how I got by
The agony of loneliness
Just got too much for me
I couldn't wait forever
Needing love so desperately
So I found new lips to kiss me
New arms to hold me tight
I found new love and happiness
To fill these empty nights
You took my love for granted
Now my heart has found a new home
I couldn't wait forever
Forever's just too long
I couldn't wait forever
Forever's just too long"
"(Dolly Parton)
I wish you all the luck I wish you only the best
Satisfaction in love, and true happiness
I wish you blue skies and rainbows, I wish you joy pure and sweet
I wish you all that you wish for, but only if you're with me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I wish you nothin' but trouble if you've decided to leave
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I have had you too long, I have given too much
I have loved you too strong to think of giving you up
I've always envied those lovers that wish you well when you leave
And wish you luck with another; but there are others like me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
And every face you look into, I hope you're haunted by me
Yes, I'm possessive and jealous; at least I speak honestly
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy, never ever ever happy
Never ever ever happy
With anybody but me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I wish you nothin' but trouble if you've decided to leave
I'm just not like those heroes found in books and on TV
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy
I hope you're never happy with anybody but me
I hope you're never happy"
"Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Let me tell you 'bout my first lover.
He's sweet and kind and he's mine all mine.
He treats me good like a lover should and makes me love him,
I really, really love him,
Oh, I love him so,
And I'll do ev'rything I can to let him know.
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Let me tell you 'bout my other lover.
He treats me bad, makes me sad,
Makes me cry but sill I can't deny that I love him,
I really, really love him,
Oh I love him so,
And I'll do ev'rything I can to let him know.
Darling, Well, Don'tcha know that I can tell whenever I look at you,
That you think that I'm untrue,
'Cause I said that I love two,
But I really, really do.
'Cause you're a split personality.
And in reality, both of them are you.
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,"
"(Dolly Parton)
You make me act like a fool
You treat me mean and cold and cruel
You make me do things that I hate to do
Why do you make me act like a fool?
Now that you know just how much I care
You treat me mean and it ain't right nor fair
I keep holdin' on though I don't know what to
While you make me act like a fool
You know just how to hurt me and you often do
When we're out in publib I start fightin' with you
You start trouble in private when nobody knows
Oh, then you go away smellin' just like a rose
Though you make me act like a fool
You treat me mean cold and cruel
You make me do things that I hate to do
Oh, why must you make me act like a fool?
You know just how to hurt me as you often do
You start flirtin' in public with somebody new
You start trouble in private when nobody knows
Oh then you go away smellin' just like a rose
Though you make me act like a fool
You treat mean and cold and cruel
You make me do things that I hate to do
Oh but why do you make, oh why do I let you
Make me look like a fool?"
"(David McDade)
Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll fly away to you, if only pretending
We'll be like bluebirds do, the beautiful lie
The beautiful lie, the beautiful lie
Everytime the bluebird sings
My heart takes wings to the sky
The bluebird greyside fly
To my place in your eyes
Cause after all, I did all I could
And you did your best, just the same
Nobody won, we both lost, no one's to blame
But I'll find my way to you, if I'm only pretending
And we'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie
We'll be like bluebirds, live the beautiful lie"
"I'll be home for Christmas you can count on me
Fileds have snow and mistletoe and presents under the tree
Christmas Eve will find me where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas if only in my dreams
Christmas Eve will find me...
If only in my dreams
Yes I'll be home I'll be home for Christmas"
"I woke up this morning in a strange place
I looked into the mirror at a strange face
Then I looked for you but you could not be found
And then I felt the lonely comin' down
I walked across the room to the empty bed
Saw the imprint on the pillow where you laid your head
The presence of you still lingered all around
And once again I felt the lonely comin' down
Then I felt the lonely dripping down my face
As I realized no one could take your place
I wondered where the love had gone that we had found
And then again I felt the lonely comin' down
I wondered where the love had gone that we had found
And again I felt the lonely comin' down
Mmm..."
"I went into his prison cell
To write his story, if he'd tell
He spoke as tears, fell from his eyes
And he told me when, and how and why
And he said
I asked my love to take a walk
Just to walk, a little ways
And as we walked, then we could talk
About our future wedding day
But when she said, she could never be mine
Well I held a knife against her breast
As into my arms she pressed
She cried ""my love, don't you murder me
'Cause I'm not prepared for eternity""
Then only say that you'll be mine
And in no others' arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
I started home twixt twelve and one
I cried, ""My God, what have I done?""
I've killed the one I love tonight
Because she would not be my bride
Well only say that you'll be mine
And in no others' arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
Down by the banks of the Ohio
Save my soul Lord
Save my soul
There beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio"
"They say the love 'bove will get you at the age of twenty-three
Well I'm not tellin' my age but something got a hold on me
I'm just cravin' some lovin' in the old fashion way
Honey linger near and listen to all I had to say
Why don't you haul off and love me one more time
Why don't you squeeze me until I'm turning blind
If you don't cuddle off and love me like I want you to do
I'm gonna haul off and die over you
[ steel ]
I can feel your warm lips near me hear you breathe so soft and fine
I can feel the matrimony crawling up and down my spine
I don't believe this love will hurt you cause it feels so nice and kind
It seems mighty close to heaven when your love is on the line
Why don't you haul off and love me...
I'm a gonna haul off and die over you"
"Lord take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark
Too dark to see
I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door
Chorus:
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knockin' on heaven's door

"I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven oh what a beautiful sight
And I met all the stars in hillbilly heaven oh what a star spangled night
Last night I dreamed I went to hillbilly heaven
And just as I arrived the old curtain lifted
And there on stage stood who else but Roy Acuff and Tex Ritter
They said well how you doing come on in here
I know there's some folks you want to see
Over there's our newest member your old friend Conway Twitty say Hello Darlin'
And there's gentlemen Jim Reeves singin' with heaven's choir
Roger Miller he just got here he's making everybody laugh
Course you know Roy Orbison can sing just as high as anybody here
And Ernest Tubb can sing as low
And Patsy Cline well bet she's the best singin' angel here
And Dottie West is probably the prettiest
There's the old pea-picker Ernie Ford
Jimmy Rodgers George Morgan Hank Williams
And the wandering boy Web Pierce
The old honky tonker himself Lefty Frizzell
My goodness what a group
Would you just listen to Mother Mabel
Over there pickin' the Wildwood Flower with the angel band
You know I personally think she's just about God's favorite
And Marty Robbins well he's still gettin' more encores than anybody else up here
Just like he used to down on earth
Yeah well there's Elvis they still call him the King
But we know they're not talking about the real king up here
I dreamed I went to hillbilly heaven oh what a star studded night
Then I ask Roy and Tex I said well who do you think will be showin' up
Say within the next 40 50 60 years
They handed me a big tallybook and in it I saw names like Johnny Cash
George Jones Merle Haggard Don Gibson Mel Tillis Farren Young Kitty Wells
Some of the newer ones like Vince Gill and Garth Brooks
Course they talked about Minnie Pearl the Judds Tanya Tucker Reba McEntire Hank Jr
Oh of course Buck Owens Roy Rodgers Gene Autry Randy Travis and Willie Nelson
There's old Chet
I said well where's Porter Wagoner's name oh there it is
And then there was Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette and Dolly Parton
Oooh that's when I woke up
I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven oh what a beautiful sight
And I met all the stars in hillbilly heaven oh what a star spangled night"
"THE LORD ID MY SHEPHERED , THE LORD IS MY SHEPHED
MY FRIEND AND HELPER, I SHALL NOT WANT
HE'S THERE TO GUIDE ME , STANDING BESIDE ME

SPOKEN:THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD, I SHALL NOT WANT
HE MAKETH ME TO LIE IN GREEN PASTURES
HE LEADETH ME BESIDE STILL WATERS
HE RESTORETH MY SOUL
{I SHALL NOT WANT...}
HE LEADETH ME IN THE PATHS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR HIS NAME' SAKE
AND YEA, THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH.
I WILL FEAR NO EVIL : FOR THOU ART ME;
THY ROD AND THY STAFF,THEY COMFORT ME.
[I SHALL NOT WANT...]
THOU PREPAREST A TABLE BEFORE ME IN THE PRESENT OF MINE ENEMIES;
THOU ANNOINTH MY HEAD WITH OIL; MY CUP RUNNETH OVER.
SURELY GOODNESS AND MERRY SHALL FOLLOW ME ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE.
AND I SHALL NOT DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER"
"I'm not the kind of girl that married 'Dear Dad'
I don't bake apple pies and cookies from scratch
I'm not even handy with a needle or thread
But you'll never go hungry and I'll make your bed
I'll make your bed a place you can't wait to go
Softer than feathers and as sweet as a rose
Smooth satin pillows I will fluff for your head
And you'll want for nothin' and I'll make your bed
I'll love you to sleep at night, wake you with a kiss
Things that I can't do I swear you won't miss
I promised forever on the day that we met
That I love you truly and I'll make your bed
To ru tu tu ru to do de de de oh
To ru tu tu ru to do de de de ah
To ru tu tu ru to do de de de oh
I'll love you truly and I'll make your bed
And I'll clothe you in dreams or I will feed you with love
Show you a magic life that few have dreamed of
I know this can be the love you'll never regret
'Cause I'm your's forever and I'll make your bed
I'll make your bed a place you can't wait to go
Softer than feathers and as sweet as a rose
Smooth satin pillows I will fluff for your head
And I'll love you truly and I'll make your bed
I'll love you to sleep at night, wake you with a kiss
Things that I can't do I swear you won't miss
Forever and always I will prove what I said

"I've been sittin' here looking at the clock big daddy
Allready you're a half hour late.
I've been pulling back the curtains, peeping out the window
Wish you wouldn't make me wait
You better move it on home, boy, you better move it on home.
I've been sittin' here listening to the jukebox playing
And forgettin' where I ought to be.
Zipping on a cool one having me some good fun
Time got away from me.
I better move it on home, I better move it on home.
[Chorus]
Better spin them wheels and make it on back
To heaven on earth and lovers' at
Like a rolling stone, you better move it on home.
I've been here cooking you a nice hot supper
And you can't even eat it on time
Heating up the meat loaf and stiring up the gravy
Is kind a messing up my mind
You better move it on home boy, you better move it on home.
I've been speeding through the traffic, passing everyone
I remember what I forgot.
Stepping on the gas and driving kind of fast
Hoping I won't get stopped.
Better move it on home, better move it on home.
[Chorus: x 2]
She: Better move it on home, boy right on this time or I'm gonna shake it.
He: I'm on my way babe, but the traffic is murder
She: That's what I thought the trouble is at home, if you're not at home soon.
He: Traffic is messing up my mind
She: ... and you're messing up mine."
"It seems we lost the feeling somewhere along the way
The distance now between us grows farther day by day
We never love each other we're just passing off the time
Wasting love yours and mine
Wasting love love divine wasting love yours and mine
There's nothing left between us just the ties that bind
Wasting love yours and mine wasting love
We just might find happiness with somebody new
For all the love we're wasting surely could be used
Not long ago our love was so true and kind
Now it's been wasted yours love and mine
Wasting love love divine...
Wasting love yours and mine wasting love"
"Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see
Another day goes by, and still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place for you and me
You just wait and see. Wait and see"
"(Bob Ferguson)
Carroll County's pointed out as kind of square
The biggest thing that happens is the county fair
And I guess that's why it seemed like such a big event
What we all call the Carroll County accident
The wreck was on the highway just inside the line
Walter Browning lost his life and for a time
It seemed that Mary Ellen Jones would surely die
But she lived long enough for her to testify
Now Walter Browning was a happy married man
And he wore a golden wedding ring upon his hand
But it was gone nobody knew just where it went
He'd lost it in the Carroll County accident
Mary Ellen testified he flagged her down
Said he was sick and could she drive him into town
And no one even doubted what she said was true
Cause she was well respected in the county too
Now I went down to see the wreck like all the rest
The bloody seats, the broken glass, the tangled mess
But I found something no one else had even seen
Behind the dash in Mary's crumpled up machine
A little matchbox circled by a rubberband
And inside the ring from Walter Browning's hand
And it took a while to figure out just what it meant
The truth about the Carroll County accident
By dark of night I dropped the ring into a well
And I took a sacred oath that I would never tell
The secret of the Carroll County accident
Cause the county ordered dad a marble monument
I lost him in the Carroll County accident"
"(Johnny Cash)
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the ties that bind
Because you're mine I walk the line
I find it very very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes I admit it, I am a fool for you
Because you're mine I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day's light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk that line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I'm gonna walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
I'm gonna walk it, walk it, walk it
I'm gonna walk that line
I'm gonna walk it because you're mine
I'm gonna walk it, walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
I'm gonna walk it, walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
I'm gonna walk it
I'm gonna walk the line"
"If she brings you happiness
Then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if she ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
Though it hurts to let you go
Darling I want you to know
I'll run to you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear
That she's made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls
I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away each teardrop you've cried
If she ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls
All I Estare Candor me necesites a tu lado
Para borrar cadda lagrima que haya llorado
If he ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls"
"As I sit here tonite the jukebox's playin
The song about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words they are saying
It brings memories when I was a trusted wife
It was not God who made Honky Tonk Angels
As you said in the words of you're song
Too many times married men think, they're still single
And that's why many a poor girl do go wrong
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame
It was not God who made HTA
As you said in the words of you're song
Too many times married men think, they're still single
And that's why many a poor girl do go wrong"
"I know what you're thinking when you look at me
The love in your eyes is so easy to see
It's real and it's good what I feel for you
Love is worth living when you love like we do
I understand when you're not feeling well
If there's something on your mind I always can tell
I'm there when you need me and you're there when I need you
Love is worth living when you love like we do
Love is worth living when you love like we do
We found the happiness that very few do
You know that I want you and you know that I want you
Love is worth living when you love like we do
[ piano ]
Love is worth living...
Love is worth living when you love like we do"
"I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time
But that was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine
But that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
I thought I'd stay single always be free
But that was before I met you
I said that no sweet thang could ever hold me
But that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you
That was before I met you"
"(Dolly Parton)
Hello you said the day we met
Handing me a yellow rose
You asked me out
And to your surprise
And to mine I said I'd go
I thought it so romantic
And I found you sweet and bold
Though we'd only met
I still said yes
To a single yellow rose
And for years to come
You were the one
To sleep with me at night
To laugh and talk
And share my thoughts
And hold me when I'd cry
And on every occasion
And for no good reason to
A big bouquet or a single yellow rose
Was sent from you
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so
I never see a yellow rose
That I didn't think of you
It's still my favorite flower
Though the yellow's turned to blue
The day you left my teardrops fell
Upon your farewell not
You said goodbye like you said hello
With a single yellow rose
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
Oh I still love you so
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Sweet yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so"
"The city streets are empty, it's beginning to feel like dawn
The lights have gone out, the sun is coming on
We've been standing here for hours watching the river flow
You walked into my life tonight but if you've got to go
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
I've been saving all my secrets, spending my time alone
I've given up on the life I used to know
I've been waiting for one person to love me like a friend
You walked into my life tonight but if it's got to end
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
Oh, it's easy now to tell you how I'm dreaming 'bout tomorrow
Cause you'll be there to share that dream with me
But now it's time to close your eyes put this night away
And keep it safe, a perfect memory
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
Oh, oh, oh
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a little while
Then say goodnight but never say goodbye
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while
Then say goodnight but don't you say goodbye
Say goodnight while there's still a star to wish on
Say goodnight while the moon is still in your eyes
Let me touch your smile and hold you for a while"
"I never had a pair of shoes that weren't all hand-me-downs
And daddy's morning coffee came from ol' left over ground
My mama wore no jewelry or any store bought stuff
And home was on a hillside forty miles from Poplar Bluff
[Chorus:]
Forty miles back in Missouri there's a different way of life
Where a man thinks of his neighbor and not his neighbor's wife
Life is far from fancy sometimes mighty rough
But contentment makes it worth it forty miles from Poplar Bluff
Our only family treasure was a beat up radio
But it took us to the places where we knew we'd never go
We never had much money but we always had enough
'Cause money never mattered much forty miles from Poplar Bluff
[Chorus:]
Well nearly every winter when the snow is on the ground
And the roads would all be closed and we couldn't get to town
But if daddy had his tobacco, grandma had her snuff
Then the winters didn't seem so long forty miles from Poplar Bluff"
"(Dolly Parton)
I feel so out of place here
With this high society
These high fallutin' people
Don't know what to make of me
I feel like a minnow in a sea of Moby Dicks
A small fry in a big pan
They're caviar -- I'm fish sticks
Fish out of water
I know I don't belong
Fish out of water
Everything I do is wrong
My style of hair, the clothes I wear
The way I speak, the things I eat
The way I act, my lack of tact
Nothin' seems to fit
Fish out of water
Flounderin' round
Out of my element
But I'm just as good as they are
Why do I feel second rate
It's like, ""Sorry Charlie,
We want only tuna with good taste""
I guess you could say Wal-Mart
Is quite a way from Gucci's
I'm Timex, they're Rolex
I'm Captain D's, they're sushi
Fish out of water
I've had it to the gills
Fish out of water
With these yuppie-guppie frills
Yeah, I'm a square in a round hole
A catfish in a goldfish bowl
A little fish with lots of soul
Out of my element
Fish out of water
Flounderin' round just for the Halibut
Save me, save me
S.O.S. somebody
Save me, save me
Somebody rescue me
Fish out of water
Somebody throw me in
Fish out of water
On a scale of one to ten
I'm a two, perhaps a three
Compared to the big fish in the sea
I'm washed ashore so save me please
I'm in an awful fix
Fish out of water
Rescue me
And you better do it quick
Fish out of water
It's such a culture shock
Fish out of water
My stomach's tied in knots
Fish out of water
Fish out of water"
"If you need me I'll be gone
The bed's still warm where you just left but it'll be colder where I've slept
I've always been where you needed me but I ain't the fool I used to be
You come home all hours of the night the fragrance on you ain't old spice
Tonight when you come draggin' home and find you need me I'll be gone
I'll be gone like the moon when the sun comes up
Gone like the dew from the buttercup
Gone like a woman treated wrong
If you need me I'll be gone
So what am I still doing here you've been doing me wrong for years
Tired of pickin' up and puttin' out I'm a leaving you lock stock and house
So bye bye baby that's it I'm packed I'm a leaving now but I'll call back
And leave this message on the code a phone sayin'
If you need me, well, I'll be gone
I'll be gone like the moon when the sun comes up
Gone like the moon when the sun comes up
I said if you need me, well, I'll be gone
If you need me I'll be gone
I said if you need me, well, I'll be gone, gone
If you need me I'll be gone gone
If you need me I'll be gone"
"(Porter Wagoner & Dolly Parton)
Tonight all is quiet in Mission Chapel
And the music, like his love, has died away
And I'm standing in the middle of these memories
Mission Chapel memories of our wedding day
I see the rice still scattered all around
That veil upon my satin wedding gown
And the wedding bells that rang are silent now
Only Mission Chapel memories all around
Tonight I'm all alone at Mission Chapel
And I'm thinking of my love so far away
While I'm standing in the middle of all these memories
Mission Chapel memories of our wedding day
I see the rice still scattered all around
That veil upon my satin wedding gown
The gown I wore when I became his bride
And now these Mission Chapel memories fill my eyes
As these Mission Chapel memories fill my eyes"
"(Dolly Parton)
I used to sit for hours as a kid
Dangle my feet from an old flat bridge,
Seein' myself in the water below
Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw
I recall a vacant old shack
Down by the edge of the tobaccer patch
A child's reflection in a dirty window
Shatter my image with the stones I'd throw
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
I'm far from perfect, but I ain't all bad;
It hurts me more than it makes me mad
You gather your stones by stoopin' so low
Then shatter my image with the stones you throw
If you live in a glass house, don't throw stones
Don't shatter my image 'til you look at your own
Look at your reflection in your house of glass
Don't open my closet if your own's full of trash
Stay out of my closet if your own's full of trash
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
A long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the stones I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
They shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones they throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
Don't shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw
Shatter my image with the stones you throw,
You shatter my image with the stones you throw"
"Let's drink a toast to what might've been
To all that we were but can't be again
And let's just be thankful we parted as friends
Here's to the past, let the future begin
Oh, and here's to your wildest dreams
And here's to your everything
May your life be blessed with sweet happiness
Baby, here's to your wildest dreams
I made a promise that I wouldn't cry
You go and chase your rainbows, go on reach for the sky
But come hold me close now, look deep in my eyes
Tell me you love me then kiss me goodbye
Oh, and here's to your wildest dreams, baby
And here's to your everything
May your life be blessed with sweet happiness
Baby, here's to your wildest dreams
I?ll always love you and I'm on your side
In whatever you do, I will take pride
And here's to your wildest dreams, baby
And here's to your everything
May your life be blessed with sweet happiness
Baby, here's to your wildest dreams
Baby, here's to your wildest dreams
Dream on, baby"
"(Porter Wagoner)
When your heart feels like a feather in a whirlwind
And you see stars in the middle of the day
And you feel so light you could fly
And you think that any moment the slightest breeze might blow you away
That's love you're feeling
That's love with feeling
Touching, tender love inside your soul
That's love you're feeling
This love with feeling
That takes you away on love wings of solid gold
When you're all alone
And each minute seems like eternity
As thoughts of love come rushing through your mind
In the middle of the night
You feel it kiss you while your alone
Don't be alarmed its only this love of mine
That's love you're feeling
That's love with feeling
Touching, tender love inside your soul
That's love you're feeling
Oh, that's love with feeling
That takes you away on love wings of solid gold"
"(Porter Wagoner)
If I cross your mind, please let me cross it slowly
Let me stop and reminisce with you for a while
And if I cross your mind, please remember only good things
Think of me as happiness if I cross your mind
There must be a million thoughts rushing through your mind
And if there's one of me love, among them that you find
Please stop for just a little while and treat it extra kind
When you think of me love, if I cross your mind
If you must hide my memory when you're with someone else
Then make mine very special when you're by yourself
For only in a memory can one turn back the time
To lovely tender moments that linger in your mind
There must be a million thoughts rushing through your mind
And if there's one of me love, among them that you find
Won't you stop for just a little while and treat it extra kind
When you think of me love, if I cross your mind
Think of only good things if I cross your mind"
"LIFE RIDES THE TRAIN
WRITER PORTER WAGONER
Time waits for no one time never will
But moments of happiness can make time seem still
But time moves on swiftly passes life by while life rides the train time always flies
Life rides the train for some it moves slow
Some never find where their train of life will go
If it's bound to hell or to heaven on high
And while life rides the train time always flies
As life rides the train some get off the track
For one careless moment but never get back
Until it's much too late time has passed them by
So while life rides the train time always flies
Life rides the train..."
"(Dolly Parton)
We sang a love song the day that we met
You thought that we made the perfect duet
You liked my performance so you wanted to know
If I would stay on as the star of the show
And beautiful music we made for a time 'til she changed our tune
And you added new lines
Our duet arrangement became a trio
Now you want a star, but I just think you should know
I don't play second fiddle in nobody's band
And I'm no back-up singer and I won't be a fan
And I'm nobody's co-star
I just play leading rolls
And I don't want the part, don't want a part
Won't play a part unless it's star of the show
Oh, she's stealing the show that's been so dear to my heart
She's changing our song 'til I'm not sure of my part
She sharing the spotlight and there's not room for both
Now one or the other is the star of the show, the other goes
Life is a show and the show will go on
The world is stage, loves an act we perform
There's always some new act somewhere up the road
And I'll always be staring in somebodies' show
I don't play second fiddle in nobody's band
And I'm no back-up singer and I won't be a fan
And I'm nobody's co-star
I just play leading rolls
And I don't want the part, don't want a part
Won't play a part unless it's star of the show
I don't play second fiddle in nobody's band
And I'm no back-up singer and I won't be a fan
And I'm nobody's co-star
I just play leading rolls
And I don't want the part, don't want a part
Won't play a part unless it's star of the show
If I don't star in your show
Well I'm still a star and I can still go
You know I got to be, I got to be the star of the show"
"(Dolly Parton/Bill Owens)
You lied to me
I can't believe
That I've been such a fool
I thought this time
I might find
Someone who would play by the rules
My mind said no
But my heart said go
And again I've made the wrong turn
Now here I stand
My heart in your hands...
And I've gone from burning to burned
Ah, you'd think by now
I'd know how
To keep this heart of mine safe
It goes to show
You just never know
Who can you trust these days
How could I make
The same mistake
But as far as I'm concerned
Got myself to blame
Got to close to the flame
Now I've gone from burning to burned
Everyone knows
The old saying goes
That a fool in love
Never learns
But I guess I forgot
'Cause the fire was too hot...
Now I've gone from burning to burned
Oh I guess I forgot
'Cause the fire was too hot...
Now I've gone from burning to burned"
"(Porter Wagoner)
Now and then, here and there, I still see you
And sometimes my memory lets me hear your voice, so soft and low
But like the wind you travel in, you seem to come and go
At times, my mind is crystal clear
And then I think of you
Then the spin of the room I'm in
Brings you into view
Love that once
Held my mind completely in control
Now makes it spin like tornado wind
As it comes and goes
Well, look who's here
I told myself that you'd be coming soon
I hope that you can stay for a little while
It's so lonesome in this room
And you look just the same today
Do you still love me so?
What's that you say, you can't stay?
You seem to come and go
At times my mind is crystal clear
And then I think of you
Then the spin of the room I'm in
Brings you into view
Love that once
Held my mind completely in control
Now makes it spin like tornado winds
As it comes and goes"

Of all the roads I've traveled and all the sights I've seen
The most amazing thing is the power of our dreams
And anything is possible for those who can believe
Just get your heart to rearrange its priorities
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
It takes faith in one another to see things eye to eye
And it's hard to trust but you know it's worth the try
There's a candle in my window and whenever you feel blue
You can bet your bottom dollar I'll be there for you
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little bit harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
Oh I do believe in miracles
But I know they don't come easy
So why don't we give destiny
A helping hand
For us to make love work
We've got to try a little bit harder
And for love to work we gotta hold on
A human heart is just too precious
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work
Life is just too beautiful
To spend it feeling hurt
Let's start to take the chance to make love work"
"Ooh, but love was just so hard to find
'Til you came along into my life
And then I thought I would lose my mind
When you said that you wanted to be mine
And ever since that day I've been hooked
Nothin' can turn me away
This livin' with you is like a dream come true
And it grows more and more everyday
Ooh, I'm reachin' the highest of highs
Every time I look into your eyes
You ask how I feel, I can say it out loud
I feel like a million inside
I never thought this could happen to me
You got me just where you wanted me, baby
And for your love I would do anything
Every night I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
Drivin' home from this sleepy old town
When my day's work is all through
The sun and the lights, well, I wish I could fly
To get back faster to you
I waited all day by the telephone
Starin' at the clock on the wall
The hours are so long when you're free from my arms
And I just can't wait to hold you
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
Ooh, you're givin' me chills up my spine
I'm feelin' so fine, goin' out of my mind
And I don't care if it never stops
I'll love you right up until I drop
You know I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool, fool for your love
I'm just a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
'Cause I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool, I'm a fool, I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool and I can't get enough
For I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love"
"Now we don't know what Heaven looks like,
But we've seen enough Hell... right here and right now
But when the road is the roughest,
And the problems are the toughest,
Or when the times are the hardest and that ol' sky turns the darkest,
You gotta keep the faith,
'Cause I believe there's a better day,
And those ol' blues, why there gonna just roll right on away,
I know they are, listen to me.
All this blue, ain't sky and sea,
Some of this blue's bound to get on me,
But the blues, don't come to stay,
They'll move away
On a better day.
Troubles and woes and misery,
Ain't gonna get the best of me,
Lift the shades, fix my gaze,
On a better day
Clear the way
Better days, just up ahead
When sorrow ain't sleepin' in my bed,
When people ain't messin' with my head,
There's a better way,
There's a brighter day,
Oohh there's a better day
With clearer skies
Hope and promise on the rise
Oh the future that is looking bright
On a better day look away, look away
(interlude)
ohh ohh woahh ohh hmmm mmm hmmm
There's a better day
Oh better days, just up ahead
When sorrow ain't sleepin' in my bed,
And people ain't a messin' with my head,
There's a better day,
There's a better day
All of this blue, it ain't sky and sea
some of that blue's gonna to fall on me.
Oh the future's looking bright
There's a better day, look away, look away
Mmmhmmm mmm"
"It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
In your hand, in your hand
Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh i could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
As we walk along my thoughts are tumblin'
Round and round, round and round
Underneath our feet are someplace rumblin'
Underground, underground
Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh i could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
I've got reason a plenty for goin
This i know, this i know
The weeds have been steadily growin'
Please don't go, please don't go
Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
I could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh i could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
You know that was the last thing on my mind"
"Two little children a boy and a girl
Sat by an old church door
The little girl's feet
Were as brown as the curl
That fell on the dress that she wore
The little boy's cloths were all tattered and torn
They shown beneath his blue eyes
Why don't you go home
To you mommy I said
And this was the maddens reply
Mommy's in heaven
Angels took her away
Left Tim and I all alone
We've no one to love us
And daddy is dead
And our darling mother is gone
Mommy got sick
Angels took her away
To dwell in those mansions so bright
She said she would come
For her children some day
And I guess she's coming tonight
The sexton came early
To ring the church bell
And found them
Beneath the snow white
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell
Up in heaven with their mommy that night"
"What to do and where to start?
Things are falling all apart
Trying hard to move ahead
But keep losing ground instead
Still I have to take a chance
Putting fear and doubt aside
Had no warning in advance
Nothing left to do but try
[Chorus:]
And I just might make it work
I just might make it after all
I just might rise above the hurt
Thought I've suffered quite a fall
But I have to get a grip
And hold on to it like a vice
Have to face the falling chips
I just might make it, I just might
Oh, I might have been a fool
But its true that love is blind
And you have broken every rule
You've taken all that yours and mine
And How does one go on with life?
When your shattered so inside
Pieces of a love gone wrong
Well, ya pick'em up and you move along
[Chorus:]
But I just might make it work
I just might make it after all
I just might rise above the hurt
Thought I've suffered quite a fall
I just might live to see the day
I can say ""hey I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright""
I better go on either way
Rise above it, I just might be stronger then I know
Well, I might even be surprised
I've got to get on with my life
I just might make it
I just might
Nothin left to do but try
I might make it
I just might"

Last night you breathed the deepest sigh
Turned away with those gold cold cool eyes
You said won't you give me space to breathe
But my tears gave you confidence to leave
Now you say I'm just too much for you
There are things you'll never know
If you lie and cheat so easily
Ya better go, you better go
Go, go, go, you better go
All I know is how I feel
And my heart is always yours to steal
But you take and never give to me
Your kisses are charity
Your kisses are charity
Yesterday you were my brightest star
But even when you're near
I don't know where you are
I was wrong to show my weaker side
Now it's much too late to cry, cry, cry
I was blind to put my trust in you
If you leave me, I'll fall apart
Did you plan to make a fool out of me
From the start, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal
But you take and never give to me
Your kisses are charity
Your kisses are charity
Now you say I'm too much for you
There are things you'll never know
If you lie and cheat so easily
Ya better go, you better go
Go, go, go, you better go
All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal
But you take and never give to me
Your kisses are charity
You never give to me
All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal
But you take but never give to me
Your kisses are charity
Your kisses are charity"

Send me the pillow that you dream on

"You can't reach me anymore
You say I'm not the girl that you remember
You say that I hve changed so much and you can't seem to rach me
Well you destroyed everything I used to be before and you can't reach me anymore
I was looked up to you while you were looking down
It used to turn me off inside when you would turn me down
Now you want the love from me that you destroyed before
But you can't reach me anymore
Now you say you love me more than anything
I used to love you that way now I don't feel a thing
The love that once lived in my heart don't live there anymore
And you can't reach me anymore

Love that once lived in my heart it don't live there anymore

"In a shingle covered cottage at the foothills of blue stacks
Near a mountain stream that's flowing crystal clear
Where the humming birds and honey bees feed on Mama's roses
My mem'ries just grow sweeter with the years
Mem'ries of my childhood are as sweet as mountain honey
And as fresh as a dew on morning glory vines
I grew up surrounded by the sights and sounds of nature
And they're forever present in my mind
But I'm headed in the wrong direction home
Headed in the wrong direction home
There's no place like home
But I'm headed in the wrong direction home
Teardrops mingled with the summer rain that was a falling
The day I left my mountain home behind
With a suitcase in my hand and a hope in my heart
I was following a dream I had to find
In that shingled covered cottage at the foothills of the smokies
Waits a family hat I'm longing to see
And mountain streams and fields of green
And rolling hills stay in my dreams
But I'm many, many miles from Tennessee"
"(Dolly Parton)
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am
If you need a love that's true
Need someone to stand by you
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am
If you need a helping hand, need someone to understand
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am
Here I am, I'm reaching out to give you love that you're without
I can help you find what you've been looking for
Here I am, come to me, take my hand 'cause I believe
I can give you all the love you need and more
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am
My world is such an empty place
I need someone to fill the space
And here I am, oh here I am, here I am
'Cause I've got so much love to give
I need someone to share it with
And here I am, oh here I am, here I am
Here I am, I'm reaching out to give you love that you're without
I can help you find what you've been searching for
Here I am, come to me, take my hand 'cause I believe
I can give you all the love you need and more
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am"

It's a dirty job
But somebody's got to do it
Better get to it
Somebody's gotta do it
Whatever it takes, whatever it takes
Any work at all
Is better than none
Better buckle down to it
Gotta get the job done
Gotta earn my pay... I gotta earn my pay
I can't wait around on the lottery
And there ain't no millionaires
Lookin' for me
And somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody
I can think of better things
I'd rather do
I might get lucky
And I'm hopin' to
But until I do
I gotta compromise
The job ain't much
But at least it's mine
It beats standin'
In the unemployment line
Put pride aside
And I'll improvise
Even if I do get a better job
Somebody else
Has gotta fill my spot
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody
Somebody
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
It's a dirty job
It's a low-down dirty job
Somebody
Even if the rules are too hard to follow
Even when pride is too hard to swallow
It's another day so it's another dollar
That's what it's all about, Oh
It's a dirty job
But somebody's got to do it
Better get to it
Somebody's gotta do it
Whatever it takes
Gotta keep the faith
Any work at all
Is better than none
Better buckle down to it
Gotta get the job done
Gotta earn my way
And it's a workin' day
The job ain't much
But at least it's mine
It beats standin'
In the unemployment line
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody's gotta do it, do it
Somebody
Somebody
It's a dirty job
Somebody's gotta do this low-down dirty job
Somebody
It's a dirty job, it's a dirty job
It's a low-down dirty job
Somebody
Somebody
Somebody"

Let me walk in the sunshine of your smile
Let me hide in the shadows of your eyes
Let me lie in the safety of your arms
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
I'll keep you warm
Let me be the someone that you need
Let me be the shelter that you seek
Let me be your strength when you are weak
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
Let me walk in the sunshine of your smile
Let me hide in the shadows of your eyes
Let me lie in the safety of your arms
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
I'll keep you warm
Let me be the one always around
Let me help you up when you are down
Let me make a smile out of a frown
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
Let me walk in the sunshine of your smile
Let me hide in the shadows of your eyes
Let me lie in the safety of your arms
And let me be the fire that keeps you warm
I'll keep you warm
Let me be the fire that keeps you warm"
"An acre of diamonds I'd offer to you
A solid gold mansion, an airplane or two
This whole world would be yours to have and to hold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold
I'd be, oh, so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
The tears that have fallen won't buy you a thing
The heartaches you've caused me won't pay for a ring
The love that I wanted would not have grown cold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold
I'd be, oh, so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold"
"It wasn't very long ago
We had a love few people know
And everything was going oh so fine
I trusted you, you trusted me
The way that it's supposed to be
But love slipped from us somewhere down the line
We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did, everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find
It's gone but we can't understand
How luck could slip right through our hands
All down the line things seemed so very right
The love we shared through all these years
We both knew that we were sincere
Then suddenly it left just overnight
We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did, everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find
Now that we've gone our separate ways
I still recall those brighter days
Days that didn't seem so very long
Neither of us ought to blame
We overly know that it's a shame
And all that we had going now is gone
We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did, everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find"
"I'm to the point where it don't add up
I can't say I've come this far
With my guitar on pure dumb luck
That's not to say, I know it all
'Cause every time I get too high up
On my horse I fall
'Cause I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I need, Jesus & gravity
But I'm as bad as anyone
Takin' all these blessings in my life
For granted one by one
When I start to think and it's all me
Well, something comes along
And knocks me right back on my knees and
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I need, Jesus & gravity
He's my friend, He's my light
He's my wings, He's my flight
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I'm gonna need
I've got Jesus, I got Jesus
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I'll ever need
'Cause I've got Jesus & gravity
I've got something lifting me up
Something holding me down
Something to give me wings
And keep my feet on the ground
I've got all I need
'Cause I've got Jesus & gravity
Jesus, I got Jesus, I've got Jesus
He's my only friend
He lifts me up, He give me wings
He gives me hope
And He gives me strength
And that's all I'll ever need
As long as He keeps lifting me
He is my light, He is my guide
He is my wings, He is my flight
Lift me, I've got Jesus
I've got Jesus and that's all I need"
"There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road
I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild
Sometimes there is a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Runnin' like a child from these warm stars
Down the seven bridges road
There are stars in the southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time sweet as honey
Down the seven bridges road
There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road
Down the seven bridges road"
"It's funny how love goes
'Cause I know this could never work out
But honey, how love grows
Even though there's no reason to doubt
This can never be
You keep saying it's wrong
Neither one of us is free
Still I want to hold on
When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
Even a fool would let go
Love has no reason
Like the words in a song that don't rhyme
My love has no season
I just know that it's there all the time
Maybe just you and me
I can't believe that it's wrong
Thinking about you and me
Just makes me want to hold on
When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying
Even a child would say no
When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
Even a fool would let go"
"(Gale Garnett)
We'll sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
I will never love you
The cost of love's too dear
But though I'll never love you
I'll live with you one year
And we will sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
I'll sing to you each morning
I'll kiss you every night
But darlin', don't cling to me
I'll soon be out of sight
But we can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
My daddy he once told me
Hey, don't you love you any man
Just take what they can give you
And give but what you can
And you can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way
And when our year has ended
And I have gone away
I'll often speak about you
And this is what I'll say
You know we sang in the sunshine
We laughed every day
We sang in the sunshine
Then I went on my way"
"There's nothing left to tie us to each other anymore
The love we knew is gone and that's a fact we can't ignore
There's nothing left to loose ends on all the ties that bind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
There's no use in wasting the good years that we have left
When we might find happiness with somebody else
There's no chance for us we can see it we're not blind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
The blame belongs to both of us I guess we didn't try
Love is like a garden without care we let it die
The flower of love can't bloom if the sun don't ever shine
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
[ piano ]
The blame belongs to both of us...
Though it hurts we know we must leave it all behind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
You're wasting mine you're wasting mine"
"Well, I wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Cause there ain't no smog, no smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bill
Now but once I had me a man on Rocky Top
Half bear the other half cat
Well, he was wild as a mink but he was sweet as soda-pop
I often think about that
Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Now once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
Lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
And some say they never will
Did you know corn don't grow at all on Rocky Top?
The dirt's too rocky by far
And that's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar
Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Now I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped luck a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a dad-burn pity
Life can't be simple again
Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee
Rocky Top, Tennessee
Tennessee, Rocky Top"

SURELY GOODNESS AND MERRY SHALL FOLLOW ME ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE.
AND I SHALL NOT DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER"
"Back through the years I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
""Perhaps this coat will brang you good luck and happiness""
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colors that my momma made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my momma made for me
So with patches on my britches, holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
and my coat of many colors my momma made for me
And oh I couldn't understand that for I thought I was rich
And then I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed
And why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes
They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
One is only poor only if you choose to be
It is true we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors momma made for me
Made just for me"
"(Dolly Parton)
The hardest thing I've done or that I'll ever do
Was to just walk off and leave you
But I knew I had to leave you
'Cause I couldn't stay and watch you
Falling out of love with me
The worst pain that I've ever known
Or that I'll ever know
Was to see your love-a-dying
And to have to watch it dying
And I couldn't stand to watch you
Falling out of love with me
I'm hurting now, but still it's better
I left while love was still alive
It was dying and I'd rather
I didn't have to watch it die
The loneliest I've ever been
Or that I'll ever be
Now that I'm without you
But I couldn't stand to watch you
Falling out of love with me"
"You never cease to amaze me
You can still make me crazy
Baby you can turn me on with just your eyes
You're just so darn appealing
Ooh, you stir up sexy feelings
Every man in the room would love to try you on for size
Baby ,wait 'til I get you home
Wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home, sweet baby
Wait 'til I get you home
Oh baby you still make me
Feel feelin's that can take me
To places where I've never been before
Well honey I've got a feelin'
We'll make some shadows on the ceilin'
Tonight by candlelight behind closed doors
Baby, wait 'til I get you home
Wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home, sweet baby
Wait 'til I get you home
Your lovin' gets better each time we're together
It's always exciting and new
Each time we discover, we're still like young lovers
It's always been magic with you
Baby wait 'til I get you home
You just wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home sweet darlin'
Wait 'til I get you home
Wait 'til I get you alone
Wait 'til I get my hands on you
Wait 'til I get you home, sweet baby
Wait 'til I get you home, sweet darlin'
Wait 'til I get you home
You just wait, you just wait
I can't wait, I can't wait"
"Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as goneI stand here in the doorway of the room where you lie sleeping
In hopes that I don't wake you up with the sounds of my weeping
It breaks my heart to see you laying there
Alone in the bed we used to share
'Cause you no longer want me and I wonder what went wrong
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone
There's so much more between us than just these lonely walls
The echoes of our dying love lingers in the halls
Living separately together in a house that's not a home
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone
Through the eyes of a broken heart, I watch my whole world fall apart
I'm trying to revive a love that's died
Hopelessly I'm holding on to a love I know is gone
Gone, but not because I haven't tried
Disappearing from your door way now the hurt is twice as strong"
"(Bill Owens)
Love is only as strong as your weakest moment
And in that moment of weakness anyone can do wrong
Oh, weak woman, like a crooked river
Follows a path of least resistance
I went in the wrong place at the right time
Where I didn't have any business
Temptation overcame me and now I
I'm ashamed of me
But how can I ask the one I love
For his forgiveness
Love is only as strong as your weakest moment
And in that moment of weakness
Anyone can go wrong"
"You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind
Oh yes you did you started it like you start all our fights
No I didn't do no such thing and let that a dirty lie
Nothin's ever your fault and nothin's ever mine
You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind
Well you've burned the supper up again that's nothing new
I just figured you'd pack that all on me
Well you're the one that caused it oh it's always me
When you're always lookin' faults ain't hard to find
We delight in pickin' fights cause our love's the fightin' kind
Two lovers both too stubborn
To take the blame for anything do we blame it on the other
Some love is understanding and there's careless love in line
It takes all sorts and mine and yours is known as the fightin' kind
Okay Miss Priss what is it now now I know you done this
What how am I supposed to shave that ain't never been my problem
Now I don't care about you using my razor
But did you have to use my brand new blade
New blade boy it's good that is really good
That's real good to think I went to all that trouble tryin' to fix that nice for you
That's fixed up nice I'll probably keep it for washin' the soap off the wall
Oh there ain't no soap or I ain't got no television in the bathroom
And that new blade that you vedrudged me had already been used
Two lovers both too stubborn
To take the blame for anything so we blame it on the other
What's mine is yours what's yours is yours and so on down the line
You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind
You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind"
"(Dolly Parton)
I try hard to forget you and the love I once shared with you
But my mind won't let forgetfulness come in
There's no use in pretending. The hurt is just beginning
Just when I think it's ending you're on my mind again
On my mind again, just like you've always been
On my mind with memories I'm rememberin'
On my mind again, just like you've always been
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again
Sometimes I go to places where certain things erases
All traces of your memory, now and then
Oh, then something will remind me of the love I left behind me
Then again, your memory finds me and you're on my mind again
On my mind again, just like you've always been
On my mind with memories I'm rememberin'
On my mind again, just like you've always been
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again
Yes, I find I've got you on my mind again
On my mind again"
"Now we don't know what Heaven looks like,
But we've seen enough Hell... right here and right now
But when the road is the roughest,
And the problems are the toughest,
Or when the times are the hardest and that ol' sky turns the darkest,
You gotta keep the faith,
'Cause I believe there's a better day,
And those ol' blues, why there gonna just roll right on away,
I know they are, listen to me.
All this blue, ain't sky and sea,
Some of this blue's bound to get on me,
But the blues, don't come to stay,
They'll move away
On a better day.
Troubles and woes and misery,
Ain't gonna get the best of me,
Lift the shades, fix my gaze,
On a better day
Clear the way
Better days, just up ahead
When sorrow ain't sleepin' in my bed,
When people ain't messin' with my head,
There's a better way,
There's a brighter day,
Oohh there's a better day
With clearer skies
Hope and promise on the rise
Oh the future that is looking bright
On a better day look away, look away
(interlude)
ohh ohh woahh ohh hmmm mmm hmmm
There's a better day
Oh better days, just up ahead
When sorrow ain't sleepin' in my bed,
And people ain't a messin' with my head,
There's a better day,
There's a better day
All of this blue, it ain't sky and sea
some of that blue's gonna to fall on me.
Oh the future's looking bright
There's a better day, look away, look away
Mmmhmmm mmm"
"(Though I'm only second best you're still first with me)
I tried to make you love me I've done everything I could
I thought if I tried long enough maybe someday that you would
But there was someone else before me and it's her you're lovin' still
And I know no matter what I'd do I'm only second best
Only second best that's all I will ever be
Even though I'm second best you're still first with me
And I'll be loving you when they fall my hand I guess
I love you even though I know I'm only second best
I know you've tried to love me and I'd hope you would in time
I know that when you're holding me it's her that's on your mind
Now I know you can't get over her but I love you nonless
But it makes no difference what I'd do I'm only second best
Only second best...
I love you even though I know I'm only second best"

Daddy was an old time preacher man
He preacher the word of God throughout the land
He preached so plain a child could understand
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
He told the people of he need to pray
He talked about God's wrath and judgement day
He preached about the great eternity
He preached hell so hot that you could feel the heat
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
Aunt Leanona would get up to testify
And we'd sing ""In The Sweet By And By""
The we'd sing ""I'm On My Way To Canaan Land""
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
Revivals and camp meetings went for weeks
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
But the aisles were always filled at altar calls
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man"

Tonight all is quiet in Mission Chapel
And the music, like his love, has died away
And I'm standing in the middle of these memories
Mission Chapel memories of our wedding day
I see the rice still scattered all around
That veil upon my satin wedding gown
And the wedding bells that rang are silent now
Only Mission Chapel memories all around
Tonight I'm all alone at Mission Chapel
And I'm thinking of my love so far away
While I'm standing in the middle of all these memories
Mission Chapel memories of our wedding day
I see the rice still scattered all around
That veil upon my satin wedding gown
The gown I wore when I became his bride
And now these Mission Chapel memories fill my eyes
As these Mission Chapel memories fill my eyes"
"(Dolly Parton)
John Daniel came to town one summer afternoon
Wearin' dirty work clothes so everyone presumed
He was just another logger from the loggin' camp nearby
And he was, but there was somethin' different in John Daniel's eyes
John Daniel was a young man, not more than twenty-four
And there was an air about him that one could not ignore
And in spite of callused hands & dirty clothes, his face was kind
And I wanted so to know what was in John Daniel's mind
John Daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's somethin' about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
I rented him a room; he went upstairs like all the rest
It was Saturday and he'd be goin' in to town, I guessed
But he left in a robe and sandals, with a Bible in his hand;
And I thought to myself, John Daniel, I don't understand
Now I'd planned to meet some friends of mine when I got off at three,
In the park we often gather to talk of love and peace
When I got there I found that a crowd had gathered 'round;
And there I saw John Daniel a sittin' on the ground
John Daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's somethin' about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
So, ""You want to be free,"" he said, ""Well, this is how you can.""
As he read from the Bible he held in his hand
We were searchin' for the truth not knowin' where to look,
Not knowin' that the answers all were in John Daniel's book
John Daniel told us all how we could be free
John Daniel taught us all a better way for you and me
He came to us in our own way so we'd be sure to see
He had the light and essence of the man from Galilee
John Daniel, tell me where did you come from; tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's something about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
John Daniel, John Daniel, John Daniel
John Daniel do you hold the answer to a higher plan?
John Daniel came to town one summer afternoon
Wearin' dirty work clothes so everyone presumed
He was just another logger from the loggin' camp nearby
And he was, but there was somethin' different in John Daniel's eyes
Ooh, John Daniel, tell me where did you come from
Tell me where is it you've been
John Daniel, tell me why are you different from all of these other men
John Daniel, there's something about you that I don't quite understand
John Daniel, do you hold the answer to a higher plan?"
"(Johnny Cash)
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the ties that bind
Because you're mine I walk the line
I find it very very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes I admit it, I am a fool for you
Because you're mine I walk the line
As sure as night is dark and day's light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk that line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I'm gonna walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
I'm gonna walk it, walk it, walk it
I'm gonna walk that line
I'm gonna walk it because you're mine
I'm gonna walk it, walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
I'm gonna walk it, walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
I'm gonna walk it
I'm gonna walk the line"
"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.
Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight."
"There's a picture that I carry
One we made some time ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me
I say just ""Someone I use to know""
Just someone, I used to spend some time with
Just a flame, that's lost its glow
But I don't them of the nights I cried without you
I say just ""Someone I use to know""
Just someone, I use to run around with
Just a friend from long ago
I don't tell them, how lost I am without you
I say just ""Someone I use to know""
I say just ""Someone I use to know"""
"I lie in bed beside you and watch you while you sleep
And wonder who I was before I loved you
Lying here beside you feeling so complete
Thinking how I love and need and trust you
Because I love you I'm a brand new person now because you love me
I can face the world and have the cause I love you
Because you love me because I love you
[ strings ]
Sweeter even still is knowing that you're lying there
And let you soon awake and reach to hold me
And anyway you want me that's the way that I am yours
Love as strong as this lets you control me
Because I love you...
Because I love you..."
"(Dolly Parton)
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
Just because it feels right does not make it so
So we struggle through life in horns and halos
Tempted and tried with each step we take
We stumble and slide and make our mistakes,
Ask God to forgive us for all of our sins,
Then we take off our horns and wear halos again
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
Just because it feels right does not make it so
So we struggle through life in horns and halos
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
We're praised or we're scorned, we either run or we faint
Oh, but life is a challenge from the day that we're born
Just tryin' to balance halos and horns
It's heaven or hell, halos or horns
Halos and horns, sinners and saints,
Hearts that are torn between what's wrong and ain't
But just because it feels right; well, that don't make it so
So we struggle through life in horns or halos
It's either horns or halos"
"Precious memories, unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me
And the sacred scenes unfold
Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And those old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear
Precious memories
How they linger
How they ever flood my soul
Then, the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious memories
How they linger
How they ever flood my soul
Then, the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious memories"
"Something in your eyes makes me want to lose myself
Makes me want to lose myself in your arms
There's something in your voice makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life
If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how long I've felt so low
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along
And change my life the way you've done
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
A window breaks down a long dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see through the dark there's light
If you knew how much this moment means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
If you know how happy you are making me
I've never thought I'd love anyone so much
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong"
"FIGHT AND SCRATCH
Duet by Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner
Copyright 1970
Fight and scratch fight and scratch that's all we ever do
There surely must be more to love than to fight and scratch with you
You you to fight and scratch with you
Well you just bought a foal last month now you want a wig
It looks like you couldn't understand my paycheck ain't that big
Well what about the dough you lose in them poker games downtown
I figured you'd mention that smart aleck
Yeah and that brand new boat and that fishin' gear
But no uhhuh I don't reckon that'd count really
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Sometimes I swear I think that you're the devil in disguise
Cause when you're mad you oughta see the fire fly from your eyes
Well you don't look so cute yourself when you're mad at me
And if you don't like the way I look then you know how to leave Bossy Catfish
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Well I love you and you love me but we're always findin' fault
But the way we fight you wouldn't know that we had any love at all
We just fight like cats and dogs we'll leave then come right back
For what excitement would we have if we didn't fight and scratch
Fight and scratch fight and scratch...
Why don't you drop dead oh you'd like me to and I'll live forever just for spite
Why don't you keep your big mouth shot
Well why don't you just make me if you think you're big enough
Yeah and I could whip you with both hands tied behind
Yeah you just try it with me and I'll knock your brains out
With a stick of soap that's good Catfish
What's a catfish why'd you call me that
They're all mouth and no brains boy that's really good
It's all I can do to keep from laughin' hah
That's funny you sure are a fynny little fellow"
"(Dolly Parton)
I love you, I love you
My heart seems to whisper
But my lips cannot form those words
I know my heart
Is calling out to you
In a voice you've already heard
Does your heart feel as if
It could burst any second
Is it racing, will not slow up
Do you just want to be
With me endlessly
Well I'm thinking
We might be in love
We might be in love
The best I can tell
I thinkin' thoughts
That I've never pondered
And I'm feeling like I've never felt
It's like I drink
From some magic posion
Sipping from your loving cup
Intoxicated, infatuated
I'm thinking we might be in love
We might be in love
What else could it be
These feelings of wonder
Passion and romance
Excitement and pure ectasy
We might be in love
And it might be forever
I think there's a future for us
If you just want to be
In and all over me
It might be, we might be in love
I promise for keeps
If you're feeling like me
Then it might be
We might be in love
I dare say
We might be in love"
"From the start I promised you that I would always be
Waiting here at anytime you ever needed me
I loved you then and I love you now as I always will
And I am always waiting willing to forgive
I'll be your shelter from the storm
My love will keep you safe and warm
I'm a harbor on your stormy sea you can always come to me
For I am always waiting
My arms are always open wide and I will dry the tears you cried
If you should ever need someone darling let it be me
I will mend your broken heart and I'll replace the missing parts
I am always waiting anytime you need me
I'll be your shelter from the storm...
For I am always waiting"

"Oh Lord my God when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made
Now I see the stars and I hear the rolling thunder
Thy art throughout the universe displayed
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art oh
How great Thou art
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation
To take me home what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall kneel in humble adoration and there proclaim my God
How great Thou art
Then sings my soul"
"(Dolly Parton)
You look at me that way
I know what your eyes say
Your eyes reflect love and desire
I see that you need me
I need you to please me
You touch me and set me on fire
It's the way that you love me
The way that you touch me
The way that you whisper my name
I cannot resist you
Each time I kiss you
Then everything goes up in flames
Baby I'm burning out of control
Baby I'm burning body and soul
Hot as a pistol of flaming desire
Baby I'm burning
You got me on fire
I'm on fire
This red hot emotion
Puts fireworks in motion
It looks like the fourth of July
There's no use in fighting
The fire you've ignited
Just stand back and watch the sparks fly
Baby I'm burning out of control
Baby I'm burning body and soul
Hot as a pistol of flaming desire
Baby I'm burning
You got me on fire
Baby I'm burning
Baby I'm burning
Baby I'm burning
Baby I'm burning
Baby I'm burning out of control
Baby I'm burning body and soul

"You and me and her and him must get together
And see if maybe we can find a way
To put an end to hurting one another
Cause he don't know and she don't know how much we hurt each day
It's not fair and you and I both know it
To have to hide and love the way we do
The time is now that we must get together
Her and him me and you
[ steel - fiddle ]
She and I had lost it long before I met you
We tried and tried but all the love had gone
And I guess respect is all that's kept me with him
Cause there hasn't been no love there in so long
It's not fair and you and I both know it...
Her and him me and you"
"We Irish love to sing
We Irish love to dance
We Irish love to party
Whener we get the chance
We have a lot of troubles
But we have a pint of Guiness
And forget about our woes
Ei-ee-ei, ei-ee-ei, we Irish are the best
We love our myths and stories
We love a mournful song
We love our joyful music
And a good old sing-a-long
We love our pennuwhistle
Uilleann pipes and air bodhran
We Irish love our football
Our heros and our homes
Repeat Chorus
We Irish love St. Patty
We love to celebrate
And nothing suits us better than
An all-out green parade
Green beer and hate and jackets
Green dresses, shirts and ties
And nothing could be brighter
Than the light in Irish eyes
We got a pub on every corner
And a church to worship in
We party hard the pray the Lord
Forgive us of our sins
We rid ourselves of grief and guilt
Relieve our trouble hearts
I know God loves the Irish
And accepts us as we are
Repeat Chorus

Ei-ee-ei, ei-ee-ei, we Irish are the best

"Hey girl, I wanna give you some friendly advice
He's got you cryin', oh, he's done it again
He's made a date and he didn't show
You know he's done this to you so many times
When you gonna let him go?
He doesn't treat you little a lover should
He could be so downright cruel
Can't understand why you're hangin' with him
Girl, don't you be a fool
Go on and dump the dude
You know he's got a rotten attitude
He always leaves you in a cryin' mood
Take my advice, don't you think twice
Listen to what I'm telling you
Go on and dump the dude
You know that we've been friends for so many years
And I've never ever seen you this way
So torn apart, how he gets to your heart
With all the little games that he plays
Just give him up, get him out of your life
Promise me that once and for all
You're gonna tell him that it's over and done
The very next time he calls, ain't you now?
Dump the dude
You know he's got a rotten attitude
He always leaves you in a cryin' mood
Take my advice, find somebody nice
Listen to what I'm telling you
Go on and dump the dude
Girl, I know you may think this is none of my business
But the fact that we're friends, I believe that makes it my business
I care about you but I ain't preachin'
I think you should dump the dude
I don't know why you'd want to settle for less
When you could have so much more
You know that you deserve only the best
So what are you waiting for?
Go on and dump the dude
You know he's got a rotten attitude
He always leaves you in a cryin' mood
Take my advice, don't you think twice
Find yourself somebody nice
Go on and dump the dude"
"(Porter Wagoner)
Now and then, here and there, I still see you
And sometimes my memory lets me hear your voice, so soft and low
But like the wind you travel in, you seem to come and go
At times, my mind is crystal clear
And then I think of you
Then the spin of the room I'm in
Brings you into view
Love that once
Held my mind completely in control
Now makes it spin like tornado wind
As it comes and goes
Well, look who's here
I told myself that you'd be coming soon
I hope that you can stay for a little while
It's so lonesome in this room
And you look just the same today
Do you still love me so?
What's that you say, you can't stay?
You seem to come and go
At times my mind is crystal clear
And then I think of you
Then the spin of the room I'm in
Brings you into view
Love that once
Held my mind completely in control
Now makes it spin like tornado winds
As it comes and goes"
"To know, know, know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
I'll be good to him
I'll bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him
Yes, just to know him
Is to love love love him
And I do
Why can't he see
How blind can he be
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me, ooh
To know, know, know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know him
Is to love love love him
And I do"
"THE LORD ID MY SHEPHERED , THE LORD IS MY SHEPHED
MY FRIEND AND HELPER, I SHALL NOT WANT
HE'S THERE TO GUIDE ME , STANDING BESIDE ME
THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD, I SHALL NOT WANT
SPOKEN:THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD, I SHALL NOT WANT
HE MAKETH ME TO LIE IN GREEN PASTURES
HE LEADETH ME BESIDE STILL WATERS
HE RESTORETH MY SOUL
{I SHALL NOT WANT...}
HE LEADETH ME IN THE PATHS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR HIS NAME' SAKE
AND YEA, THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH.
I WILL FEAR NO EVIL : FOR THOU ART ME;
THY ROD AND THY STAFF,THEY COMFORT ME.
[I SHALL NOT WANT...]
THOU PREPAREST A TABLE BEFORE ME IN THE PRESENT OF MINE ENEMIES;
THOU ANNOINTH MY HEAD WITH OIL; MY CUP RUNNETH OVER.
SURELY GOODNESS AND MERRY SHALL FOLLOW ME ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE.
AND I SHALL NOT DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER"
"(Dolly Parton)
Late one cold and stormy night I heard a dog a' barkin'
Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a' knockin'
I wondered who could be outdide in such an awful storm
Then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms
Before I could say a word she said, 'My name is Sandy
And this here is my puppy dog, it's name is little Andy'
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said
Ain't ya got no gingerbread
Ain't ya got no candy
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little Andy
Patty cake and bakersman
My mommy ran away again
And we was all alone and didn't know what else to do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you
Giddy up trotty horse, going to the mill
Can we stay all night
If you don't love us no one will
I promise we won't cry
London bridge is fallin' down
My daddy's drunk again in town
And we was all alone and didn't what we could do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you
She was just a little girl, not more than six or seven
But that night as they slept the angels took them both to heaven
God knew little Andy would be lonesome with her gone
Now Sandy and her puppy dog won't ever be alone
Ain't ya got no gingerbread
Ain't ya got no candy
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little (whispers) Andy"
"(Dolly Parton)

"(Dolly Parton)
I cry awake at night and hug my pillow
And pray that I will die before I wake
No such luck
Another day of cryin'
Don't know how much more my old heart can break
Flooded with these memories and emotions
The tears like rain keep on falling down
They say that I'll forget
But my face is just as wet
As it was the day you left this town
Drowning in this endless, endless
Drowning in an endless stream of tears
It's relentless and I'm defenseless
Drowning in an endless stream of tears
I can't believe that I can talk about it
I never thought I'd live to see this day
But a broken heart won't kill you
You just want to die
But you have to go on livin' anyway
I feel it through and through
And I've never been so blue
And I cried a river over you
Drowning in this endless, endless
Drowning in an endless stream of tears
It's relentless and I'm defenseless
Drowning in an endless stream of tears
Oh, I'm drowning in this endless, endless
Drowning in this endless, endless
Drowning in this endless, endless
Drowning in this endless stream of tears"
"(Porter Wagoner)
Loneliness found me one time too many
And I cheated I cheated on you
But I'd give my soul now if only I hadn't
But you see what loneliness can do
It seems that you're gone so much from me
And I try to find things to do while you're gone
But I get so lonesome just staying at home
And it's hard to enjoy things alone
Loneliness found me just one time too many
And I cheated - yes, I cheated on you
But I'd give my life now if only I hadn't
But you see now what loneliness can do
Loneliness found me"
"Who do you think you are
What do you think this is
A game you can play
Tryin' to steal him away
Well, I don't need a heartache like this
Well, don't think I don't go through hell
But heaven is what we both want
He's easy to love, but he's hard to give up
And if you think I will, well, you're wrong
Chorus:
The best woman wins
I will fight 'til the end
I'll lay down and die if I must
I'll beg and I'll plead
I will suffer and bleed
But he must make a choice between us
This soap opera play that we're in
Is just like you watch on t.v.
But I never thought that I'd ever get caught in it;
Starring you, him and me
In love as in war all is fair
So a fight to the finish begins
When you fight from desire
You fight fire with fire
So may the best woman win
Repeat chorus
So may the best woman win"
"If I had wings I would fly away from
All my troubles ,all of my pain
And I would fly to a place of comfort
Heaven knows I need a change
If I had wings ,Lord give me wings
Oh I've had my share of sorrow
Walked alone,a lonesome to road
I could use a new tomorrow
If I had wings I'd make it so
One cannot predict the future
One cannot undo the past
But we can make the present useful
Build the future that will last
If I had wings I'd fly away from
All my troubles ,all my wounds
And I would fly 'till I found freedom
If I had wings I'd up and go
If I had wings ,Lord give me wings
If I had wings I'd fly away from
All my troubles ,all my wounds
And I would fly 'till I found freedom
If I had wings I'd up and go
If I had wings ,Lord give me wings
If I had wings, oh if I had wings
If I had wings,Oh,just give me wings
If I had wings , If had wings I'd make a change
If I had wings,if I had wings
oohhhhh woaah oohh woaah
If I had wings, if I had wings"

Stay out of my bedroom
Don't be messin' up my pillows and sheets
With your powder and perfume
If you don't have some understanding of me
Don't be kncokin' on my door
I don't want you to play in my fantasies
Stay out of my bedroom
Baby, if you can't take the heat
If you want it, come and get it, baby
Satisfaction guaranteed
I'm a pleaser, free and eager
I ain't never had as much fun as I need
Easy lovin', that's down my alley
I may be easy but, at least I'm cheap
Stay out of my bedroom, baby
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Stay out of
Stay out of
You're dealin' with some hot stuff
Baby, can you deal with the heat?
We might burn on forever, we might burn on tonight
Where there's smoke there is fire from the flames that I ignite
The heat is intense when the fire's blazin' high
Slavin' over all those red hot lovers at night
If you come to my bedroom the heart of the heat
I will pleasure your body in sheer ecstasy
I will touch you in places no one else ever reached
Till you won't remember anybody else but me
If you want it come and get it
If it burns you don't come cryin' to me
Don't come knockin' on my door
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Don't be peepin' through my window
If you don't appreciate what you see
Stay out of my bedroom, baby
Baby, if you can't take the heat
Stay out of, stay out of
You're dealin' with some hot stuff
Baby, can you deal with the heat?
Stay out of my bedroom...
If you can't take it, stay out of my bedroom"
"My baby makes me proud
Lord, don't he make me proud
He never makes a scene
Hangin' all over me in a crowd
'Cause people like to talk
Lord, don't they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights
I know he'll be leavin' with me
And when we get behind closed doors
Then we let out hair hang down
Then he makes me glad that he's my man
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
My baby makes me smile
Lord, don't he make me smile
I'm never far away
Or too tired to say I want to
I'm purring like a kitten
When he's out in public with me
But when they turn out the lights
He brings out the tiger in me
And when we get behind closed doors
Then we let out hair hang down
Then he makes me glad that he's my man
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors"
"(Buck Ram)
Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell
Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I've played the game but to my real shame
You've left me to dream all alone
Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal
Oh yes I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearin' my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around
Too real is the feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal
Oh yes I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearin' this old heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around
But I know what I am
I am the great pretender"
"Whenever forever comes, when darkness shall hide the sun
I'll still be shining with love for you
When glory bells chime, my love will ring true
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my love will be yours always
Whenever forever comes, when all things are said and done
I'll still be feeling the same way I do
I'll be there for you and still wanting you
God gave you to me, and me to you
And you will still be the one whenever forever comes
We'll float on a cloud through eternity
You'll gather the stars, you'll give them to me
I'll give you the moon and we'll replace the sun
Whenever forever comes, whenever forever comes
What would I have ever done had I not had you to love?
You've given me more than I ever dreamed
Loving you more every day, so it seems
Greater than all other loves I have seen
Its essence will linger on whenever forever comes"
"No matter how you're tempted
Don't say yes to me
Don't make this night as smooth to lead me on
It's just that I'm so lonely and I need someone
I've been too lonely too long
Oh please be strong enough to refuse me
Before I let myself do something wrong
For down inside I'm not that kind of woman
I've been too lonely too long
Oh please don't take advantage of the situation
For I'm afraid that I'm too weak to resist temptation
When you're used to being loved
It's hard to live alone
I've been too lonely too long
I've been too lonely too long"
"(Mel Torm/Robert Wells)
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some missletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with eyes all aglow
Who find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-four
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you"
"(Dolly Parton)
If I should stay
Well, I would only be in your way
And so I'll go, and yet I know
That I'll think of you each step of my way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Bitter-sweet memories
That's all I have, and all I'm taking with me
Good-bye, oh, please don't cry
'Cause we both know that I'm not
What you need
But I will always love you
I will always love you
And I hope life, will treat you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
Oh, I do wish you joy
And I wish you happiness
But above all this
I wish you love
I love you, I will always love
I will always, always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you"
"Loving you isn't good for me you keep my tears flowing
If I loved you I couldn't stay gone so there's no use in going
Loving you is a habit I can't break
I haven't found a way yet but I've been tryin'
To stop loving you but I can't wait there's no use a lyin'
Loving you is a habit I can't break
Loving you is a habit I can't break
I've been loving you much too long now to change the way I feel
So I might as well get used to these heartaches
Loving you is a habit I can't break
[ piano ]
(A habit I can't break)
Loving you is a habit I can't break...
Loving you is a habit I can't break"
"My baby makes me proud
Lord, don't he make me proud
He never makes a scene
Hangin' all over me in a crowd
'Cause people like to talk
Lord, don't they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights
I know he'll be leavin' with me
And when we get behind closed doors
Then we let out hair hang down
Then he makes me glad that he's my man
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
My baby makes me smile
Lord, don't he make me smile
I'm never far away
Or too tired to say I want to
I'm purring like a kitten
When he's out in public with me
But when they turn out the lights
He brings out the tiger in me
And when we get behind closed doors
Then we let out hair hang down
Then he makes me glad that he's my man
And no one knows what goes on behind closed doors"
"At my door the leaves are fallin'
A cold wild wind will come
Sweet hearts walked by together
And I still miss someone
I go out to a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
Cause I still miss someone
Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
Oh I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there"
"There's no love left our love's beyond help
Why do we keep on tryin' when there's no love left
The feeling we felt for each other
For a long time now has been dying
We'd both be better off without each other
We can't bring it back to life why do we keep trying
There's no love left...
[ steel - fiddle ]
When love is gone it's gone and you can't bring it back
When the warm sun goes down it turns cold
We both might as well just accept the fact
There's nothing warm left for us to hold
There's no love left...
There's no love left..."
"Sometimes I try to count the ways and reasons that I love you
But I can't ever seem to count that far
I love you in a million ways and for a million reasons
More than this I love you as you are
More than this I love you as you are
You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are
You are my thoughts when I'm awake, my dreams when I'm asleep
You are the reason for my smile, you are the words I speak
Every role I play in life you play the leading part
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are"
"Everybody wants to find a love
Somebody, somebody who will always care
We get locked up in our own worlds
With feelings and secrets we're afraid to share
But all I have to do is see you smile
And maybe, just maybe if I brush your hand
Something happens, I cannot explain
And somehow, oh, somehow I can understand
I, I think you're gonna find
Gonna find you, gonna find you
I'm reading your mind
I know you by heart
And you're so much a part of me
I know you by heart, yes, I do
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by heart
I know every time you're gonna call
I pick up the phone before it ever rings
And when you need some lovin'
I'll be there beside you, anticipating everything
Oh, it's like I always said
You're the one I want
All I want is you
I'm inside your head
I know you by heart
Girl, you're so much a part of me
I know you by heart, yes, I do
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by heart
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by heart
I know you by heart
And you're so much a part of me
I know you by heart, I know you, I know you, I know you
It's no wonder I can love you the way that I do
I can finish any sentence you start
I know you, I know you by"
"(Dolly Parton)
My dear hard workin' daddy works his life away for us
That's the way that daddy shows to us his love
And Daddy's two hard working hands
They're callous and they're sore
And Daddy's workin' boots have walked a million miles or more
As long as I remember, I remember Daddy workin'
Workin' on the job or either on the farm
Tryin' to provide for the family that he loves
And Daddy's working boots have taken many steps for us
Chorus:
Daddy's workin' boots have served as his foundation
Though just like him, they're tired and worn
For years they've helped him stand
Daddy's working boots have filled their obligation
They've walked that rocky road with a mighty, mighty man
Dear lord above, I know up there my Daddy's got a mansion
And a great reward that's long been overdue
And when it comes my Daddy's time to be with you in heaven
Spoken:
Won't cha let him walk your golden streets
In a pair of brand new golden boots
Repeat Chorus
Daddy's workin' boots"
"Find the loneliest girl in a thousand find the saddest eyes you've ever seen
Find someone who's always longing for you find that man and you found me
And all I need is you all I want is you to give my loving to all I need is you
Find a man who wakes up every morning and lives in a world of make believe
Find someone who's arms are aching for you you find that girl and you found me
And all I need is you all I want is you to give my loving to all I need is you
You're with me now so let the world forsake us
I've found my heaven here within your arms
And nothing in this world can separate us you're all I ever wanted all along
And all I need is you all I want is you to give my loving to all I need is you"
"Well, I think it's fine buildin' jumbo planes
Or takin' a ride on a cosmic train
Switch on a summer from a slot machine
Yes, you can get what you want, if you want it
'Cause you can get anything
I know we've come a long way
We're changin' day to day
But tell me where do the children play?
Well, you roll on roads over fresh green grass
With your heavy loads pumping petrol gas
And you make 'em long and you make 'em tough
And you just go on and on and it seems you can't get off
I know we've come a long way
We're changin' day to day
But tell me where do the children play?
Crack the sky, scrapers fill the air
But you keep on buildin' higher
'Til there's no more room up there?
Will you make us laugh?
Will you make us cry?
Will you tell us when to live?
Will you tell us when to die?
I know we've come a long way
We're changin' day to day
But tell me where do the children play?
Tell me where do the children play?
Well, I think it's fine buildin' jumbo planes
Or takin' a ride on a cosmic train
But, where do the children play?
Just tell me where do the children play?"
"You got a snazzy new car in your driveway
And expensive new clothes on your back
Every short skirt on the highway
Has spent time in your bachelor pad
We dance and you look over my shoulder
And make eyes at somebody else
You swear that you're not, but you know that's a croc
Cause you only care for yourself
Your attitude stinks and I hate it
You're arrogant, cocky and rude
You're selfish, conceited and jaded
Everything's all about you
You think that I'm lucky to have you
You think you're so handsome, so what
I'm callin' you out cause I don't need this crap
I'm gettin' myself outta dodge
Cause you don't know love from shinola
With you love is not what I found
A woman needs someone to hold her
Not someone to just lay her down
I want someone I can count on
A cool headed, warm hearted shoulder
To cry on, rely on, today and from now on
But you don't know love from shinola
You don't know love
From shinola
Oh but I gave you love and affection
But you never gave one iota
It was an early detection
That you don't know love from shinola
You don't know love from shinola
You don't know what true loves about
Well you'll find your world growin' colder
When you're alone and without
So go on, lover boy, have a big time
Drink up on your bourbon and cola
When you sober up you'll be *beep* outta luck
Cause you don't know love from shinola
I'm in it for love, but you're just plain stuck
You don't know love from shinola"
"I'm a little bit slow to catch on
When I do I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on
Well, I couldn't see the light for the brightness
Of the sweet little smile you gave me
I couldn't see how you were cheatin' on me
But finally I'm a catchin' on, on
Finally, I'm a' catchin' on
I'm a little bit slow to catch on
When I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on
I couldn't see the hurt for the happy
And at first that's the way you made me
It took me a while to get your style
But finally I'm a' catchin' on, on
Finally I'm a' catchin' on
I'm a little bit slow to catch on
When I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on
You say you can't see the light for the darkness
That surrounds you since I'm gone
You can't eat or sleep 'cause you're lonely
Well, finally you're catchin' on, on
Finally you're a' catchin' on
I'm a little bit slow to catch on
When I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on
I'm a little bit slow to catch on
When I do, I'm a caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on"

I'm lookin' for a way to get out there's no hope for you and me
We'll never get along everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
We stopped loving a long time ago and now all we do is disagree
There's no use to pretend there's no need to try again
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
There's no use for us to live a lie
When we're just wasting the best years of our lives
We'll never get along everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me
You and I both know one of us has to go and it might as well be me"
"(Dolly Parton)
The hardest thing I've done or that I'll ever do
Was to just walk off and leave you
But I knew I had to leave you
'Cause I couldn't stay and watch you
Falling out of love with me
The worst pain that I've ever known
Or that I'll ever know
Was to see your love-a-dying
And to have to watch it dying
And I couldn't stand to watch you
Falling out of love with me
I'm hurting now, but still it's better
I left while love was still alive
It was dying and I'd rather
I didn't have to watch it die
The loneliest I've ever been
Or that I'll ever be
Now that I'm without you
But I couldn't stand to watch you
Falling out of love with me"
"(Dolly Parton)
And Oprah was talkin' on TV this mornin'
She said when love dies, there's no need to keep mourning
The honeymoon's over, there's no vital signs
Though he's the same age I am, he's grown old before my time
And I'm tired of livin' with a dead man
I don't believe that I can
Continue in the manner I've been going
I try to dress up sexy for him
My sexy clothes just bore him
He says he's got a headache
Now my disappointment's showing, ooo-ooo"
"If you go, I'll follow you
You can't leave my love behind
If you go (if you go) I'll follow you
Even death could never end this love of mine
I have loved you for so long
With a love both true and strong
You are all I'll every have
And I'll love you good or bad
Where you go I'll go with you
No matter where you take me to
I'll go through hell And back again
I'll be with you Until the end
If you go, I'll follow you
You can't leave my love behind
If you go (if you go) I'll follow you
Even death could never end this love of mine
If you go, I'll follow you...."
"Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Let me tell you 'bout my first lover.
He's sweet and kind and he's mine all mine.
He treats me good like a lover should and makes me love him,
I really, really love him,
Oh, I love him so,
And I'll do ev'rything I can to let him know.
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Let me tell you 'bout my other lover.
He treats me bad, makes me sad,
Makes me cry but sill I can't deny that I love him,
I really, really love him,
Oh I love him so,
And I'll do ev'rything I can to let him know.
Darling, Well, Don'tcha know that I can tell whenever I look at you,
That you think that I'm untrue,
'Cause I said that I love two,
But I really, really do.
'Cause you're a split personality.
And in reality, both of them are you.
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,
Two lovers and I love them both the same.
Well, I've got two lovers, and I ain't ashamed,"
"Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
In your cowboy boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here looking like that
Here comes my baby
Draggin' my heart behind
He's drivin' me crazy
Who says love is blind
He's got a wanderin' eye and a travelin' mind
Big ideas and a little behind
Out with a different woman every night
But I remember when he was mine
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
In your high heeled boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Waltzing right in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
When you could stop traffic in a gunney sack
Why you're almost givin' me a heart attack
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that
I just can't stand it
To see him on the town
He's out slow dancing
With every girl around
I'm a softhearted woman he's a hardheaded man
And he's gonna make me feel just as bad as he can
He's got himself a mean streak a half a mile wide
But now he's dancing on this heart of mine
Ooh, Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
In your high heeled boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why's you come in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
In your high heeled boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
When you could stop traffic in a gunney sack
Why you're almost givin' me a heart attack
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that
Why'd you come in here lookin' like that"

"Min barndomstid var inte lycklig
Min ungdom melankolisk och tung
Men nÃ¥gonstans fanns Ã¤ndÃ¥ strÃ¥lar av ljus
Man ser dom inte nÃ¤r man Ã¤r ung
FÃ¶r hÃ¤r stÃ¥r du kÃ¤rleksfull framfÃ¶r mig
SÃ¤g mig, om du fÃ¶rstÃ¥tt
SÃ¤g hur jag har fÃ¶rtjÃ¤nat lyckan
Om jag ej gjort nÃ¥got gott
Intet fÃ¶der intet, det har jag fÃ¶rstÃ¥tt
Jag mÃ¥ste ha fÃ¶rtjÃ¤nat lyckan
Jag mÃ¥ste ha gjort nÃ¥got gott
Min barndomstid var inte lycklig
Min ungdom melankolisk och tung

"Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah
It's been so long
That it's wrong
Don't let me wonder life alone
Cause' there is a reason
It's not the season
It is time for us to fall in love
Give me a sign now
Show me the way
Take my hand, I won't be afraid
Show me the love that blew me away
I said
Ah, yeah
I feel alive
Ah, yeah
This feels so right
When you hold me
When you kiss me
The way you let me shine
Ah, yeah
This love will survive
So what's the deal
What do you feel
Cause' baby I can't take no more
We've got to be stronger
A little longer
I need you to take control
Give me a sign now
Show me the way
Take my hand, I won't be afraid
Where is the love that blew me away
I said
Ah, yeah
I feel alive
Ah, yeah
This feels so right
When you hold me
When you kiss me
The way you let me shine
Ah, yeah
This love will survive
This love will survive
Hey, oh
This love will survive
Oh
Ah, yeah
I feel alive
Ah, yeah
This feels so right
When you hold me
When you kiss me
The way you let me shine
Ah, yeah
This love will survive"
"If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share would always be
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
Make us realize our night
Is over
When you walk away from me there
Is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun
That rises o'er the land
I watch you walk away somehow
I have to let you go now
It's over
If you knew just how I really
Feel you might return and yet
There are so many times that people
Have to love and then forget
Though there might have been a way
I have to force myself to say
It's over
So I turn my back and
Turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence
Tryin' not to think at all
Send my tired feet before me
Walk the silent street before me
It's over
It's over"
"My girl don't want me cuz of my dirty laundry,
And I think that she knows,
I'm out of control,
With all of this money they all want something from me,
It's starting to show,
I'm out of control
Man I can't see shit in the spotlight,
She found receipts from the last night,
In the back of my jeans keep it real right,
I just wanna fuckin feel right,
Work long all day till the night time,
She wants to know what's the deal like,
I think that she knows can't keep sealed tight,
Doin all these things that you want like,
Girls with cocaine on they backsides,
I know, my girl don't want me cuz of my dirty laundry, let's go
My girl don't want me cuz of my dirty laundry,
And I think that she knows,
I'm out of control,
With all of this money they all want something from me,
It's starting to show,
I'm out of control
My girl don't want me cuz of my dirty laundry, I know,
My girl don't want me, no,
I wanna tell you everything I'm hiding,
I can't lie no more,
I wanna tell you everything I'm hiding
I can't lie no more,
I can't hide it no more,
I can't hide it no more
My girl don't want me cuz of my dirty laundry,
And I think that she knows,
I'm out of control,
With all of this money they all want something from me,
It's starting to show,
I'm out of control,
I'm out of control,
My girl don't want me cuz of my dirty laundry, I know"
"Die Tapete lÃ¶st sich von der Wand ab
So setzen wir zusammen
Doch blicken uns nicht an
FrÃ¼her waren wir neu
Jetzt sind wir Standard
Oft fÃ¤ngt man richtig an
Und dann kommt man nicht voran
Vor dem Fenster fliegen Funken
Und was wollen wir noch hier unten
Mach es auf und komm wir bleiben, bleiben, bleiben
Nur nicht hier
Lass uns raus, aus unseren Mustern
Komm wir fangen mit 'nem Schluss an
Mit 'nem Schluss an
Wir kÃ¶nnen immer noch frei sein
Wir haben immer noch Paris
Lass es jetzt nicht vorbei sein
Lass es jetzt nicht vorbei sein
Wir kÃ¶nnen immer noch hÃ¶her
Wir haben immer noch Paris
Weil es damals so schÃ¶n war
Weil es damals so schÃ¶n war
Und dann so wenig blieb
Fliegen fliegen matt um die Laterne
Vom Fenster Rahmen
Platzt der Lack ganz langsam ab
Auto Reifen kreischen in der Ferne
Und wir sind isoliert
Siehst du was passiert
Aus den Wolken fallen Funken
Und was wollen wir noch hier unten
Nimm die Jacke und komm wir bleiben, bleiben, bleiben
Nur nicht hier
Lass uns raus, aus unseren Mustern
Komm wir fangen mit 'nem Kuss an
Mit 'nem Kuss an
Wir kÃ¶nnen immer noch frei sein
Wir haben immer noch Paris
Lass es jetzt nicht vorbei sein
Lass es jetzt nicht vorbei sein
Wir kÃ¶nnen immer noch hÃ¶her
Wir haben immer noch Paris
Weil es damals so schÃ¶n war
Weil es damals so schÃ¶n war
Wir kÃ¶nnen immer noch frei sein
Wir haben immer noch Paris
Lass es jetzt nicht vorbei sein
Lass es jetzt nicht vorbei sein
Wir kÃ¶nnen immer noch hÃ¶her
Wir haben immer noch Paris
Weil es damals so schÃ¶n war
Weil es damals so schÃ¶n war
Und dann so wenig blieb
Oh ooh oh ooh
Oh ooh oh ooh
Oh ooh oh ooh
Wir haben immer noch Paris
Oh ooh oh ooh
Oh ooh oh ooh
Oh ooh oh ooh
Wir kÃ¶nnen immer noch frei sein
Wir haben immer noch Paris
Lass es jetzt nicht vorbei sein
Lass es jetzt nicht vorbei sein
Wir kÃ¶nnen immer noch hÃ¶her
Wir haben immer noch Paris
Weil es damals so schÃ¶n war
Weil es damals so schÃ¶n war

Oh ooh oh ooh
Wir haben immer noch Paris
Oh ooh oh ooh
Wir haben immer noch Paris
Oh ooh oh ooh
Wir haben immer noch Paris
Oh ooh oh ooh
Wir haben immer noch Paris
Oh ooh oh ooh
Oh ooh oh ooh
Oh ooh oh ooh
Oh ooh oh ooh"

"""I fear I can't go on"", she said
""I think I would be better dead""
She knelt, she cried and I held her head
I thought I knew what she was feelin'
And I assisted in her suicide
Now that she's on the other side
I know what she was after
And I
I, I, I can wait
Inside
I, I, I can wait
A cold and wet November's day
We lowered her into a grave
I had never seen her look so brave
No worms consume her body"
"[Verse 1]
Life is like a fairground ride
In love and blinded by the lights
Carousel keeps spinning 'round
Faster and faster
But I don't ever want to stop
Don't want to get my bubble popped
I'm losing all reality
I don't care
But now I'm standing on my own
And I'm in someone else's clothes
The darkness is a gaping hole
Keeps going under
Thought this was a good idea
Thought that I could have no fears
My body is in overload
Let me go
[Chorus]
Felt like flying
Now I'm crying
But oh, what the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell, what the hell?
Woah-a-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
I wish that I had a time machine
Or I could turn up all of the TV screens
I would keep running and running away
Further and further every day
I know I'm on my own
My friends keep trying to call my phone
I told them that I'd never change
I was wrong
[Chorus]
Felt like flying
Now I'm crying
But oh, what the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell, what the hell?
Woah-a-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Bridge]
Somebody get me back into reality
Somebody pull me back under
I kinda like it up here in the galaxy
Hiding, I will not be found, found
Tears of crystal fall down from my face
Losing my mind, losing my mind
You got my heart
I'm gone
[Chorus]
Felt like flying
Now I'm crying
But oh, what the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell did I get myself into?
What the hell, what the hell?
Woah-a-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Outro]
What the hell, what the hell?
What the hell?
What the hell, what the hell?
What the hell, hell?"
"See everybody needs someone by their side
And I can't go on without you another night
Since companionship's been gone
My life has been so slow
Without you, you
See it don't take a rocket scientist to know I love you
See it don't take a rocket scientist to know I need you
See if you believe that you and me can change the world someday
Then believe me when I say
I still love you
I still love you
I decided I still love you
I still love you
I decided
So what do you think
Let's get back together (let's get back together)
There's nothing it could hurt
It could only get better
Think of what it last felt like
When you and I done turned our nights into forever, see
See it don't take a rocket scientist to know I love you
And it don't take a rocket scientist to know I need you
See if you believe that you and me can change the world someday
Then believe me when I say
I still love you
I still love you
I decided I still love you
I still love you
I decided
Never dreamed I'd be so happy
And sure of myself
Baby, life without you is so dark
(so dark, so dark)
Now I know it'll never be me loving someone else
It's precious love
You're my shining star
I remember when we first fell in love
I was too young to know what it was
I couldn't address what made me melt
But quick to tell you how it felt
That life is so real
And it still is
I still love you
I still love you
I decided I still love you
I still love you
I still love you
Just think of the things we planned to do - me and you
I still love you
I'm changing the face of the new world we once knew
I still love you
So long as the sun is shine the oceans are blue
I still love you..."
"Still,
I think of you, baby
And how i grew old with you then
And this summer, you'll call-maybe
And act as if we were old friends
You'd say, 'how are you, baby'
I'd say, 'it's raining in athens'
And to this day
I nurse the fever
That spoiled my poor heart
And i've mastered the art of dealing
Slipping away without falling apart
So when this summer, you call-maybe
And ask how
I've been
I can be honest and answer plainly
'Since november, it's been raining'"

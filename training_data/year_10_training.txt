"Yeah
To all my fans
The people, who don't know..
What I been goin through
To make my, own..
Now it's time to hurt your feelings as I upsets music industry fan
Hey yo my man, look at my hand, they look human right?
You think I'm a monster, ill circus clown
Not a specimen, don't look at me funny when I come around
A&R; been tryin to figure me out for years
Tryin to re-duplicate me but they can't so they hate me
While white boys run the head of black music with a Japanese assistant
What does a Chinese kid know about the rap game? That's a shame
As I see and watch on BET
There's a million uncreative rappers tryin to be me
I'm startin to feel like Jimi Hendrix
When they covered the story who started rock
Magazines put blankets over my interviews
They don't want to see me on channel 7 news, tellin the truth
Off the project roof, they always have secret spies with eyes
Watchin me recordin my album, send in producers with wack tracks
And DAT's, messin up my whole format
Can you imagine somethin on the kneeboard with Con-Funk-Shun?
With an alternative hippie kid from the record label watchin your back
Talkin about, ""Mariah Carey's funky,""
Makin the average group buckdance like a barrel full of monkies
While I break out to shoppin mall he's makin a quick phone call
About my sound is too new and different
I need to be regular like Dru Hill and a little more ill
(Hey Keith, we want you to be ill)
Leave me alone, leave me alone!
(Politics, politics..)
Leave me alone, leave me alone!
(Politics, politics..)
Leave me alone, leave me alone!
(Politics, politics..)
Leave me alone, leave me alone!
(Politics, politics..)
OF COURSE I'm hard to work with cause you hard to work with
I don't want to meet Insane Clown Posse and collaborate
I'm tryin to innovate and think quick at a fast rate
Why you mad cause I'm original - you can't do the material
When I sit back and watch you act big
Spend your budget on your video
I'm in one of my three luxury apartments eatin Raisin Bran cereal
While you front low, I take my bike ride down to Wells Fargo
How long is it gon' take, nine-hundred-thousand in clear
Takin with a clear, I don't need a Benz this year
Took care of my paperwork
Takin United Taxi out to Vegas
While the average R&B; group is doin a promo concert
Ignorin your phone calls from broke labels
Who try to put out underground MC's
Tryin to get me to rap on a wack jazz track for one G
How dare you try to insult me?
I got 40 grand for three minutes to write a song with Prodigy
Other crews don't get budget, got the nerve to call me
Welcome to the business, stand as a witness
Work on your stomach, do physical fitness
I ain't playin, all this African stuff all look the same
I don't need a Joey Neckbone puttin his artwork on my CD
Drawin Apple Jacks and Honeycomb with me sittin on the throne
No I'm takin a regular picture by the hotel St. Bonaventure
Besides I do wear a coat in the winter
And eat at beautiful restaurants
Leave me alone, leave me alone!
(Politics, politics..)
Leave me alone, leave me alone!
(Politics, politics..)
Leave me alone, leave me alone!
(Politics, politics..)
Leave me alone, leave me alone!
(Politics, politics..)
Why you think I should wear a motorcycle helmet??
Why don't you wear it?! Put on some wings like a PARROT
Let's discuss this contract
Why are you hypin up a normal female group with fat cellulite
That sound wack? Most of why'all goin out like Uncle Tom's
Like Louis Armstrong
Wearin a tattoo and goin onstage like Tracy Chapman
I cancelled a big tour cause I was prepared
Why'all on the road with per diem money and why'all scared
While why'all walk and look hard
Your manager got his name all over your Versatile card
And plus this video treatment sucks
The fish lens effects, the lens to the camera only cost a hundred bucks
Look at the director, tryin to tell me what to do
I done this before, 14 degrees freezin cold
Doin _Poppa Large_ with a cage on my head, that's dead
Don't get your imagination too messed up
I'm wearin a Yankee hat and a Starter I'm not dressin up
How you gonna tell me what to wear?!
I don't need mascara and a stylist
Save that for a big rock group like Pantera
Experience, Next Plateau, Mercury, Wild Pitch, EMI, Capitol, DreamWorks
Never got dropped
Put my lyrics away and stopped
Too many people with hands in my projects
Havin fantasies of me bein Superman you bein stupid man
I'm like Prince, you might see me once every five years
At the record company
While most of why'all live at the label
Beggin for your rent and car notes to be paid
Under the table, doin routine dances for advances
(Ooh, you get involved!)
Leave me alone, leave me alone!
(Politics, politics..)
Leave me alone, leave me alone!
(Politics, politics..)
Leave me alone, leave me alone!
(Politics, politics..)
Leave me alone, leave me alone!
(Politics, politics..)"
"I can see you standing outside
See your shadow on the wall from a street lamp
I've got a manual instructing my brain
I turn around, cover eyes, I see you
Standing in the doorway
Standing in the doorway
I can see you
Standing in the doorway
Standing in the doorway
I can see you
I can see you walking behind
See your face silhouetted in the half light
I've got a manual instructing my brain
I turn around, cover eyes, I see you
Standing in the doorway
Standing in the doorway
I can see you
Standing in the doorway
Standing in the doorway
I can see you
I can feel your presence inside
Like a chill, like the point of a sharp knife
Instruction manual, instructing my brain
I turn around, cover eyes, I see you
Standing in the doorway
Standing in the doorway
I can see you
Standing in the doorway
Standing in the doorway
Standing in the doorway

"This union with creation is a brilliant coronet
What I cannot gain by knowledge, I infect, as I posses
Put into perspective as I walk up the facade
Instead of sinking, it's got me thinking
How could I be wrong when I am right?
I'll never know
We hear the truth and turn away
Our ears are burning every day
The quandary is the elucidation oh, oh
With sightless faith, small steps,and pride
Let that suffice, no longer a spark, it's gone ablaze, before our eyes
The whole earth trembles at his name in fear and awe
Instead of blinking, it's got me thinking
How could I be wrong when I am right?
I'll never know
We learn to sacrifice, we learn to take a life
We take and we don't give, live how we want to live
And no one wants to lie but we all have to lie
Yeah, no one wants to lie, relax, then die
We hear the truth and turn away
Our ears are burning every day
The quandary is the elucidation oh, oh
How could I be wrong when I am right?
I'll never know"
"The mid-day sky was grey and purple
At least it wasn't blue
I want the sky to be the way I am
And what I do
For I have been a lost and lonely
Sailor on your sea
Run aground by trusting signals
You were sending me
The streets are filled with empty faces
Nothing here is new
It's just the same in other places
I have journeyed to
I was the first across the water
The last across the land
I walked out of the silver mine
My pockets full of sand
Alone inside my head
Alone inside my room
I feel alone inside my head
Alone inside my tiny little world
It's not my life in those old pictures
The ones you threw away
For I was always someone else
And always far away
Walking in the darkest places
Where the mission meets
Waiting for the ground to open up
Beneath my feet
Alone inside my head
Alone inside my room
I feel alone inside my head
Alone inside my tiny little world
Alone inside my head
Alone inside my room
I feel alone inside my head
Alone inside my tiny little world
Alone inside my head
Alone inside my room
I feel alone inside my head
Alone inside my tiny little world"
"I'm going be a good girl
So everybody loves me
I'm gonna do what they say
Let them chose the games that we play
Good girl, good girl
Gonna be a good girl
Good dog, good girl
Gonna be a good girl
I'm gonna smile til it hurts
So everybody loves me
I'll bend over backwards
Swallow all my angry words
Good girl, good girl
Better be a good girl
Good dog, good girl
Gonna be a good girl
Good girl, good girl
Better be a good girl
Good dog, good girl
Gonna be a good girl
All I want is for everyone to love me
All I want is for everyone to love me
I'll get down on my knees
I'll say pretty pretty pretty please
Good girl, good girl
Better be a good girl
Good dog, good girl
Gonna be a good girl
Good girl, good girl
Better be a good girl
Good dog, good girl
Gonna be a good girl
Good girl, good girl
Better be a good girl
Good dog, good girl
Gonna be a good girl"
"You walk tall, got your head in the clouds
You talk soft, but you're thinking aloud
And you know, exactly what you want
You box shy, you're hard to get
You got the face that I can't forget
And I know, I know The Heat Goes On
I know that The Heat Goes On
I know that The Heat Goes On
You play tight, you're nobody's fool
You're not cold, but I know that you're cool
Look at you, I know The Heat Goes On
Now tell me, with your hand on you're heart
That you knew, you were right from the start
And you're sure, you felt it all along
You know that The Heat Goes On
You know that The Heat Goes On
Times to decide, times that I've lied
Problems will never be solved
Which way is wrong, which could be right?
This heat will always go on
You walk tall, got your head in the clouds
You talk soft, but you're thinking aloud
And you know, exactly what you want
You box shy, you're hard to get
You got the face that I'll never forget
You and I know, we know The Heat Goes On"

This was the place of our first date
It was a place we love
That was the place we laughed
Where we had so much fun
There was the place I met her
That's where we fell in love
And it was the place where she broke my heart
So how do we tell this story
Of someone I love so much
When she lost her feelings for me
Oh how I miss her touch
Have you ever loved someone so much
It hurts like hell
To see the love that she once gave to you
She gives to someone else
Have you ever, ever, ever loved
To find yourself
To see the love she gave
The love you made
The joys and praise
She saved for someone else
She was a girl called beautiful
And I was so proud of she
How could a girl like here
Be with someone like me
There was I time I had her heart
And oh what a time it was
But I never thought that time
Would take my only true love
So how do we tell this story
Of someone I love so much
She lost her feelings for me
Oh I miss her touch
Hook 2 times
How do I tell this story
Of someone I love so much
She lost her feelings for me
Oh I miss her touch
Hook 2 times"
"A gypsy wind is blowing warm tonight
The sky is starlit and the time is right
And still you're telling me you have to go
Before you leave there's something you should know
Yeah something you should know babe
I've seen you smiling in the summer sun
I've seen your long hair flying when you run
I've made my mind up that it's meant to be
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea
You're high above me now
You're wild and free ah, but
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Some people say that love's a losing game
You start with fire
But you lose the flame
The ashes smolder
But the warmth's soon gone
You end up cold and lonely on your own
I'll take my chances babe
I'll risk it all
I'll win your love
Or I'll take the fall
I've made my mind up girl
It's meant to be
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
It's written down somewhere
It's got to be
You're high above me
Flying wild and free
Oh but someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Out where the rivers meet the sounding sea
I feel it in my soul
It's meant to be
Oh someday lady you'll accomp'ny me"
"Per quanto dolce sia, per me
Il sapore della libertÃ 
In fondo un pÃ² di amaro sempre see'Ã¨
Restare solo non mi va
La notte Ã¨ un oceano
Attraversarla non ce la farei
Leggendo un libro o guardando un film
Ci vuole molto piÃ¹
Per questa notte ci vuoi tu
Rimani un pÃ² con me
Non mi dire di no
Rimani un pÃ² con me
Fino a quando non so
Gettala insieme con me
Un'ancora nel vento
Mi fermerÃ² cosi per un momento
Con te
E quando I viaggi tornano
Ritrovo il vuoto che ho lasciato qui
E quando anche stare in compagnia
Non mi diverte piÃ¹ dove mi aggrappo io
L'unico appiglio mio sei tu
Rimani un pÃ² con me
Non mi dire di no
Rimani un pÃ² con me
Fino a quando non so
Gettala insieme con me
Un'ancora nel vento
Mi fermerÃ² cosi per un momento
Con te
Rimani un pÃ² con me
Dammi il meglio che hai
Rimani un pÃ² con me
Quel che voglio lo sai
Lo hai giÃ  capito anche tu
Ne ho un bisogno immenso
Mi bastera cosÃ¬
Non chiedo niente di piÃ¹
Mi bastera....un respiro
Averlo qui accanto al mio
Mi basterÃ  per sentirmi vivere
Rimani un pÃ² con me
Fino a quando non so
Gettala insieme con me
Un'ancora nel vento
Mi fermerÃ² cosi per un momento
Con te, con te"
"Come with the bloody moon and the chaos
Gog and Magog triple six reigns over spirits lost
Satanic nations and thrones reign and slay
But solid is super-souls love and righteous pathways
Asking me why I ain't down with the bloodshed
Wicked fool we approve of lies as eternal truth
Worship the mark of the beast demonic feast
Seven the seals sacred faith no need to pack steal
No ""Geed-up"" rap anywhere up and on me
Strictly KRS, Public Enemy, Bob Marley
Mad ups to MLK and the infinite Ghandi
Doom to the demons that dominate all around me
Deep in the soul fool
You know you ain't right running around with your eyes shut tight
I know what it's like to not want to see the sunrise
So shattered the pictures on fire, the winter never lies
But that chemical won't always keep the empty space full
Bludgeon corrode desecrate the body temple
Half the fools we know yes they sick style sprung
Deeper and further from ourselves I have always watched us run
From the family perspective yes I've watched the dope wreck shit
Deep ""Veteranos, Tequatos"" fool this childhood knows
Deep in the soul
Fool you know you ain't right going around with them eyes shut tight
Further away from ourselves, further away from the truth
You can throw the set in the sky
But the eternal majestic Mount Zion you can't deny
A gat, a clip, a hollow-tip with your name on it
Loving to trip but one day you'll get caught up and slip
So cheap a death but my brother so precious is life
Speaking the language of fratricidal sights
You do like ""Cain"" did ""Abel"" you love to watch your brother's blood
Flow fool tell me no, spirit so cold! Denial"

When I was a child I recall and old man; everybody loved old Zeke
He was all alone, his family was gone; one day he said to me
I'm just sittin' here thinkin' about Jesus, rockin' as my old chair creaks
Some glad day I'll fly away when Jesus comes calling for me
It might be today, it might be tomorrow, maybe one day next week
I'll soon be done with trouble and sorrow when He comes calling for me
When Jesus comes calling for me
When I die don't grieve and cry
Lordy, don't feel sorry for me
Oh what a day, what a mighty fine day
When Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me
I might be in the graveyard walking talking to my family
Or I might be plowing in the field down yonder, just old Muley and me
Wherever I am, whatever I'm a doing, some sweet day I'll see
And band of angels in a cloud of glory when Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me
When I die just close my eyes
And lay me 'neath the willow tree
Oh what a day, what a mighty fine day
When Jesus comes calling for me
When Jesus comes calling for me
I'm just sittin' here watchin' for Jesus, rockin' as my old chair creaks
Some sweet day I'll fly away when Jesus comes calling for me
When He comes calling for me"
"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying the stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying the stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
Oh, it makes me wonder
Oh, it makes me wonder
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
Oh, it makes me wonder
Oh, it makes me wonder
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
And she's buying the stairway to heaven"

There is no love and there is no hate there is no feeling at all
I look at you and you look at me but we might as well stare at the wall
Cause you don't see me and I don't see you just the shadow of love that is gone
There is no love and there is no hate no reason to hurry home
There's no tiny hands to reach out to us no plans bein' made anymore
We have no tomorrow our future is gone there is only sadness in store
We don't care enough to even ask questions
And when we're together we still feel alone
There is no love and there is no hate no reason to hurry home
There is nothing to look forward to no reason to hurry home"

The first strange town I was ever in the county was hangin' a man
And nobody cared if he lived or he died and I just didn't understand
So I washed my face in the morning dew bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew and kept on moving along
The second strange town I was in they were laughing at a poor crippled man
Begging for nickels and dimes on the street and I just didn't understand
So I washed my face...
The third strange town that I was in was settled peaceful and nice
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer and to me it didn't seem right
So I washed my face...
Now someday times are bound to change it can't be very far
And each injustice that I have seen will come before the bar
Then I'll wash my face in the morning dew bathe my soul in the sun
Wash my face in the morning dew and my journey will be done"
"I flew off to the wild blue yonder
'Cause I had a dream
And I had to go
But I'm filled with a sense of wonder
From the love I shared
With a green-eyed boy
Lips as sweet as mountain honey
A body warm as home made wine
But he had no dreams
And no means for money
But he had me just anytime
Take me back, If just in memory
Fill my cup again with joy
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy
Now he was pretty
With chiseled features
Like the movie stars in the magazines
My first love and the son of a preacher
I fantasized me was James Dean
But the world outside kept pulling at me
Offered me fame, respect, and gold
Designer clothes and a fancy mansion
Expensive cars, so I chose those
Take me back, If just in memory
Fill my cup again with joy
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy
Take me back, If just in memory
Fill my cup again with joy
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney
And I still burn for that green-eyed boy
Ooh, ooh, how I love that green-eyed boy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, and I still miss
That green-eyed boy
Do you think about me
When the nights are long and cold
Do you ever miss me
Do you my green-eyed boy"

Backstory:
Tabloid prediction: Dolly Parton will announce she's falling madly in love with a 300 pound professional wrestler. She'll write a song about their relationship titled ""Headlock on My Heart"" and feature her massive muscleman in the video.
Dolly: Now this actually came out in this magazine. Now, you folks I'm sure buy these every week at the supermarket, right? And you know they never put anything in these magazines that's not true, right? So I figured since I was gonna fall in love anyhow, why wait? So I went out and I found me a 300 pound wrestler and I sat down and I wrote a song called ""Headlock on My Heart"" and I did a video. As a matter of fact, in the same magazine on a page opposite, there was a picture of Hulk Hogan. Now, I love Hulk Hogan. My Daddy's crazy about him, so I called Hulk, I said ""Would you do this?"" 'Cause the song is a fantasy, and it's about a guy named Starlight Starbright. He said ""Aw sure, I'd do anything with you, Dolly!"" I said ""Well, thanks, Hulk, I ought to hug your neck!"" So wouldn't that be something if me and Hulk really wound up getting married? Watch this video...
Song:
The first time that I saw him
Was in a wrestling magazine.
Then I watched him on TV,
Then I bought a ringside seat.
His name was Starlight Starbright,
The greatest in the land.
He sprinkled stardust in my eyes
I was his biggest fan.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Referee: 300 pounds of magic right here in the ring tonight.
Starlight Starbright: Wrestling fans, big and small, who's the greatest of them all?
Dolly: Starlight! Starlight Starbright! Starlight! Starlight Starbright!
He dazzled 'em with brilliance,
He outshined all the rest.
And I loved the heart that beat
Beneath his massive golden chest.
Spoken:
Dolly: In this ring, I thee wed.
Referee: Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
Starlight Starbright: I do!
Referee: And do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
Dolly: I do, I truly do!
Referee: I now pronounce you man and wife.
Dolly: Uh, you may now kiss the bride.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
Spoken:
Dolly: Well, it's a whole new arena for me,
But it's a whole new wrestling match for him.
I guess you could say he pinned me down for a lifetime.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
It was a takedown from the start.
He's a master of the art.
He's got a headlock on my heart.
He's got a headlock on my heart,
That it may likely never part.
He knew the ropes right from the start.
He's got a headlock on my heart."
"Hurt is no stranger to me
And oh how well I know misery
You've always hurt me
But I always forgive
And I'll hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
Oh it's my fault for loving you so deeply
I'd give you my love completely
I'd give you love but hurt is all you give
And I hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
For as long as I love you, there'll be pain
Though tears come and go
My love remains the same
I'll always forgive you
You know that I will
And I hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
Yes I've hurt for as long as I loved you
And I'll love you for as long as I live"
"Satan's got river Satan's got river deep and wide so deep and wide
Satan's got a river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming he's got folks a swimming
In the warm smooth tire
But some day Satan's river
Yes some day Satan's river is gonna run dry it's gonna run dry
What was once a smooth river hot lava will make the tide
Stay clear of Satan's river heaven's on either side
Big yachts are sailing Satan's river so smooth
Never stopping or thinking about God's golden rule
When the river starts to sinking they'll cry I've been a fool
Satan's got river deep and wide
Satan's got river and it's so deep and wide
And he's got folks a swimming in the warm smooth tide"
"Give me a word
Give me a sign
Show me where to look
Tell me what will I find
What will I find
Lay me on the ground
Fly me in the sky
Show me where to look
Tell me what will I find
What will I find
Yeah
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down

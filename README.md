# Comparing Text Generating Models

## Background
This project explores whether algorithms can be creative when learning, based on knowledge from music lyrics. The goal is to use an existing language model to generate song lyrics given a userâ€™s input of genre, year, and/or artist, then evaluate the computer generated lyrics. The model we chose to use is a recurrent neural network using Tensorflow, created by Spiglerg (link below). 

## Motivation
We would like to better understand how machines generate text and how to recognize machine-generated text in real life. Furthermore, we are exploring bigger questions, like:
* What makes a song a song?
* What metrics can be used to evaluate the computer-generated lyrics?
* What does it means for something to be creative?
* Are computers demonstrating creativity through the computer-generated lyrics?
